<h3 id="IN_1">1. <span class="smcap">The Text, its Discovery, Publication and Editions</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> story of the discovery of the book here translated so
resembles a romance as to appear like a flower in the dry
and dusty field of patristic lore. A short treatise called
<i>Philosophumena</i>, or “Philosophizings,” had long been
known, four early copies of it being in existence in the
Papal and other libraries of Rome, Florence and Turin.
The superscriptions of these texts and a note in the margin
of one of them caused the treatise to be attributed to Origen,
and its <i>Edito princeps</i> is that published in 1701 at Leipzig
by Fabricius with notes by the learned Gronovius. As will
be seen later, it is by itself of no great importance to
modern scholars, as it throws no new light on the history
or nature of Greek philosophy, while it is mainly compiled
from some of those epitomes of philosophic opinion
current in the early centuries of our era, of which the
works of Diogenes Laertius and Aetius are the best known.
In the year 1840, however, Mynoïdes Mynas, a learned
Greek, was sent by Abel Villemain, then Minister of Public
Instruction in the Government of Louis Philippe, on a
voyage of discovery to the monasteries of Mt. Athos,
whence he returned with, among other things, the MS. of
the last seven books contained in these volumes. This
proved on investigation to be Books IV to X inclusive of
the original work of which the text published by Fabricius
was Book I, and therefore left only Books II and III to be
accounted for. The pagination of the MS. shows that the
two missing books never formed part of it; but the author’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
remarks at the end of Books I and IX, and the beginning
of Books V and X<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> lead one to conclude that if they ever
existed they must have dealt with the Mysteries and secret
rites of the Egyptians, or rather of the Alexandrian Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
with the theologies and cosmogonies of the Persians and
Chaldæans, and with the magical practices and incantations
of the Babylonians. Deeply interesting as these would
have been from the archæological and anthropological
standpoint, we perhaps need not deplore their loss overmuch.
The few references made to them in the remainder
of the work go to show that here too the author had no
very profound acquaintance with, or first-hand knowledge
of, his subject, and that the scanty information that he had
succeeded in collecting regarding it was only thrown in by
him as an additional support for his main thesis. This last,
which is steadily kept in view throughout the book, is that
the peculiar tenets and practices of the Gnostics and other
heretics of his time were not derived from any misinterpretation
of the Scriptures, but were a sort of amalgam of
those current among the heathen with the opinions held by
the philosophers<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> as to the origin of all things.</p>

<p>The same reproach of scanty information cannot be
brought against the books discovered by Mynas. Book
IV, four pages at the beginning of which have perished, deals
with the arts of divination as practised by the arithmomancers,
astrologers, magicians and other charlatans who
infested Rome in the first three centuries of our era; and
the author’s account, which the corruption of the text
makes rather difficult to follow, yet gives us a new and
unexpected insight into the impostures and juggleries by
which they managed to bewilder their dupes. Books V to
IX deal in detail with the opinions of the heretics themselves,
and differ from the accounts of earlier heresiologists
by quoting at some length from the once extensive Gnostic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
literature, of which well-nigh the whole has been lost to us.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Thus, our author gives us excerpts from a work called the
<i>Great Announcement</i>, attributed by him to Simon Magus,
from another called <i>Proastii</i> used by the sect of the Peratæ,
from the <i>Paraphrase of Seth</i> in favour with the Sethiani,
from the <i>Baruch</i> of one Justinus, a heresiarch hitherto
unknown to us, and from a work by an anonymous writer
belonging to the Naassenes or Ophites, which is mainly a
Gnostic explanation of the hymns used in the worship of
Cybele.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Besides these, there are long extracts from Basilidian
and Valentinian works which may be by the founders
of those sects, and which certainly give us a more extended
insight into their doctrines than we before possessed; while
Book X contains what purports to be a summary of the
whole work.</p>

<p>This, however, does not exhaust the new information put
at our disposal by Mynas’ discovery. In the course of an
account of the heresy of Noetus, who refused to admit any
difference between the First and Second Persons of the
Trinity, our author suddenly develops a violent attack on
one Callistus, a high officer of the Church, whom he
describes as a runaway slave who had made away with his
master’s money, had stolen that deposited with him by
widows and others belonging to the Church, and had been
condemned to the mines by the Prefect of the City, to be
released only by the grace of Commodus’ concubine,
Marcia.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He further accuses Callistus of leaning towards
the heresy of Noetus, and of encouraging laxity of manners
in the Church by permitting the marriage and re-marriage
of bishops and priests, and concubinage among the unmarried
women. The heaviness of this charge lies in the
fact that this Callistus can hardly be any other than the
Saint and Martyr of that name, who succeeded Zephyrinus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
in the Chair of St. Peter about the year 218, and whose
name is familiar to all visitors to modern Rome from the
cemetery which still bears it, and over which the work
before us says he had been set by his predecessor.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
explanation of these charges will be discussed when we
consider the authorship of the book, but for the present it
may be noticed that they throw an entirely unexpected
light upon the inner history of the Primitive Church.</p>

<p>These facts, however, were not immediately patent. The
MS., written as appears from the colophon by one
Michael in an extremely crabbed hand of the fourteenth
century, is full of erasures and interlineations, and has
several serious lacunæ.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Hence it would probably
have remained unnoticed in the Bibliothèque Royale of
Paris to which it was consigned, had it not there met the
eye of Bénigne Emmanuel Miller, a French scholar and
archæologist who had devoted his life to the study and
decipherment of ancient Greek MSS. By his care and the
generosity of the University Press, the MS. was transcribed
and published in 1851 at Oxford, but without either Introduction
or explanatory notes, although the suggested
emendations in the text were all carefully noted at the
foot of every page.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> These omissions were repaired by the
German scholars F. G. Schneidewin and Ludwig Duncker,
who in 1856-1859 published at Göttingen an amended
text with full critical and explanatory notes, and a Latin
version.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The completion of this publication was delayed
by the death of Schneidewin, which occurred before he had
time to go further than Book VII, and was followed by
the appearance at Paris in 1860 of a similar text and
translation by the Abbé Cruice, then Rector of a college at
Rome, who had given, as he tells us in his <i>Prolegomena</i>,
many years to the study of the work.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> As his edition
embodies all the best features of that of Duncker and
Schneidewin, together with the fruits of much good and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
careful work of his own, and a Latin version incomparably
superior in clearness and terseness to the German editors’,
it is the one mainly used in the following pages. An
English translation by the Rev. J. H. Macmahon, the
translator for Bohn’s series of a great part of the works of
Aristotle, also appeared in 1868 in Messrs. Clark’s <i>Ante-Nicene
Library</i>. Little fault can be found with it on the
score of verbal accuracy; but fifty years ago the relics of
Gnosticism had not received the attention that has since
been bestowed upon them, and the translator, perhaps in
consequence, did little to help the general reader to an
understanding of the author’s meaning.</p>


<h3 id="IN_2">2. <span class="smcap">The Authorship of the Work</span></h3>

<p>Even before Mynas’ discovery, doubts had been cast on
the attribution of the <i>Philosophumena</i> to Origen. The fact
that the author in his <i>Proæmium</i> speaks of himself as a
successor of the Apostles, a sharer in the grace of high
priesthood, and a guardian of the Church,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> had already led
several learned writers in the eighteenth century to point
out that Origen, who was never even a bishop, could not
possibly be the author, and Epiphanius, Didymus of Alexandria,
and Aetius were among the names to which it was
assigned. Immediately upon the publication of Miller’s
text, this controversy was revived, and naturally became
coloured by the religious and political opinions of its
protagonists. Jacobi in a German theological journal was
the first to declare that it must have been written by
Hippolytus, a contemporary of Callistus,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and this proved
to be like the letting out of waters. The dogma of Papal
Infallibility was already in the air, and the opportunity was
at once seized by the Baron von Bunsen, then Prussian
Ambassador at the Court of St. James’, to do what he could
to defeat its promulgation. In his <i>Hippolytus and his Age</i>
(1852), he asserted his belief in Jacobi’s theory, and drew
from the abuse of Callistus in Book IX of the newly discovered
text, the conclusion that even in the third century
the Primacy of the Bishops of Rome was effectively denied.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
The celebrated Christopher Wordsworth, Bishop of Lincoln,
followed with a scholarly study in which, while rejecting
von Bunsen’s conclusion, he admitted his main premises;
and Dr. Döllinger, who was later to prove the chief
opponent of Papal claims, appeared a little later with a
work on the same side. Against these were to be found
none who ventured to defend the supposed authorship of
Origen, but many who did not believe that the work was
rightly attributed to Hippolytus. Among the Germans,
Fessler and Baur pronounced for Caius, a presbyter to
whom Photius in the ninth century gave the curious title
of “Bishop of Gentiles,” as author; of the Italians, de
Rossi assigned it to Tertullian and Armellini to Novatian;
of the French, the Abbé Jallabert in a doctoral thesis voted
for Tertullian; while Cruice, who was afterwards to translate
the work, thought its author must be either Caius or Tertullian.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Fortunately there is now no reason to re-open the
controversy, which one may conclude has come to an end
by the death of Lipsius, the last serious opponent of the
Hippolytan authorship. Mgr. Duchesne, who may in such
a matter be supposed to speak with the voice of the majority
of the learned of his own communion, in his <i>Histoire
Ancienne de l’Église</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> accepts the view that Hippolytus was
the author of the <i>Philosophumena</i>, and thinks that he became
reconciled to the Church under the persecution of Maximin.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
We may, therefore, take it that Hippolytus’ authorship is
now admitted on all sides.</p>

<p>A few words must be said as to what is known of this
Hippolytus. A Saint and Martyr of that name appears
in the Roman Calendar, and a seated statue of him was
discovered in Rome in the sixteenth century inscribed on
the back of the chair with a list of works, one of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
is claimed in our text as written by its author.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He is
first mentioned by Eusebius, who describes him as the
“Bishop of another Church” than that of Bostra, of which
he has been speaking;<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> then by Theodoret, who calls him
the “holy Hippolytus, bishop and martyr”;<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and finally
by Prudentius, who says that he became a Novatianist, but
on his way to martyrdom returned to the bosom of the
Church and entreated his followers to do the same.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> We
have many writings, mostly fragmentary, attributed to him,
including among others one on the Paschal cycle which
is referred to on the statue just mentioned, a tract against
Noetus used later by Epiphanius, and others on Antichrist,
Daniel, and the Apocalypse, all of which show
a markedly chiliastic tendency. In the MSS. in which
some of these occur, he is spoken of as “Bishop of Rome,”
and this seems to have been his usual title among Greek
writers, although he is in other places called “Archbishop,”
and by other titles. From these and other facts, Döllinger
comes to the conclusion that he was really an anti-pope
or schismatic bishop who set himself up against the authority
of Callistus, and this, too, is accepted by Mgr. Duchesne,
who agrees with Döllinger that the schism created by him
lasted through the primacies of Callistus’ successors,
Urbanus and Pontianus, and only ceased when this last
was exiled together with Hippolytus to the mines of
Sardinia.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Though the evidence on which this is based
is not very strong, it is a very reasonable account of the
whole matter; and it becomes more probable if we choose
to believe&mdash;for which, however, there is no distinct evidence&mdash;that
Hippolytus was the head of the Greek-speaking
community of Christians at Rome, while his enemy Callistus
presided over the more numerous Latins. In that case,
the schism would be more likely to be forgotten in time
of persecution, and would have less chance of survival than
the more serious ones of a later age; while it would
satisfactorily account for the conduct of the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
authorities in sending the heads of both communities into
penal servitude at the same time. By doing so, Maximin
or his pagan advisers doubtless considered they were
dealing the yet adolescent Church a double blow.</p>


<h3 id="IN_3">3. <span class="smcap">The Credibility of Hippolytus</span></h3>

<p>Assuming, then, that our author was Hippolytus, schismatic
Bishop of Rome from about 218 to 235, we must next
see what faith is to be attached to his statements. This
question was first raised by the late Dr. George Salmon,
Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, who was throughout
his life a zealous student of Gnosticism and of the history
of the Church during the early centuries. While working
through our text he was so struck by the repetition in the
account of four different sects of the simile about the magnet
drawing iron to itself and the amber the straws, as to
excogitate a theory that Hippolytus must have been imposed
upon by a forger who had sold him a number of documents
purporting to be the secret books of the heretics, but in
reality written by the forger himself.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This theory was
afterwards adopted by the late Heinrich Stähelin, who
published a treatise in which he attempted to show in the
laborious German way, by a comparison of nearly all the
different passages in it which present any similarity of
diction, that the whole document was suspect.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The different
passages on which he relies will be dealt with in the
notes as they occur, and it may be sufficient to mention
here the opinion of M. Eugène de Faye, the latest writer
on the point, that the theory of Salmon and Stähelin goes
a long way beyond the facts.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> As M. de Faye points out,
the different documents quoted in the work differ so greatly
from one another both in style and contents, that to have
invented or concocted them would have required a forger
of almost superhuman skill and learning. To which it may
be added that the mere repetition of the phrases that
Stähelin has collated with such diligence would be the very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
thing that the least skilful forger would most studiously
avoid, and that it could hardly fail to put the most credulous
purchaser on his guard. It is also the case that some
at least of the phrases of whose repetition Salmon and
Stähelin complain can be shown to have come, not from
the Gnostic author quoted, but from Hippolytus himself,
and that others are to be found in the Gnostic works which
have come down to us in Coptic dress.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> These Coptic
documents, as the present writer has shown elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are
so intimately linked together that all must be taken to have
issued from the same school. They could not have been
known to Hippolytus or he would certainly have quoted
them in the work before us; nor to the supposed forger,
or he would have made greater use of them. We must,
therefore, suppose that, in the passages which they and
our text have in common, both they and it are drawing from
a common source which can hardly be anything else than
the genuine writings of earlier heretics. We must, therefore,
agree with M. de Faye that the Salmon-Stähelin theory of
forgery must be rejected.</p>

<p>If, however, we turn from this to such statements of
Hippolytus as we can check from other sources, we find
many reasons for doubting not indeed the good faith of
him or his informants, but the accuracy of one or other
of them. Thus, in his account of the tenets of the philosophers,
he repeatedly alters or misunderstands his authorities,
as when he says that Thales supposed water to be the end
as it had been the beginning of the Universe,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> or that
“Zaratas,” as he calls Zoroaster, said that light was the
father and darkness the mother of beings,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> which statements
are directly at variance with what we know otherwise of the
opinions of these teachers. So, too, in Book I, he makes
Empedocles say that all things consist of fire, and will be
resolved into fire, while in Book VII, he says that Empedocles
declared the elements of the cosmos to be six in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
number, whereof fire, one of the two instruments which alter
and arrange it, is only one.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Again, in Book IX, he says
that he has already expounded the opinions of Heraclitus,
and then sets to work to describe as his a perfectly different
set of tenets from that which he has assigned to him in
Book I; while in Book X he ascribes to Heraclitus yet
another opinion.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Or we may take as an example the
system of arithmomancy or divination by the “Pythagorean
number” whereby, he says, its professors claim to predict
the winner of a contest by juggling with the numerical
values of the letters in the competitors’ names, and then
gives instances, some of which do and others do not work
out according to the rule he lays down. So, too, in his
unacknowledged quotations from Sextus Empiricus, he so
garbles his text as to make it unintelligible to us were we
not able to restore it from Sextus’ own words. So, again,
in his account of the sleight-of-hand and other stage tricks,
whereby he says, no doubt with truth, the magicians used
to deceive those who consulted them, his account is so
carelessly written or copied that it is only by means of
much reading between the lines that it can be understood,
and even then it recounts many more marvels than it
explains.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Some of this inaccuracy may possibly be due
to mistakes in copying and re-copying by scribes who did
not understand what they were writing; but when all is said
there is left a sum of blunders which can only be attributed
to great carelessness on the part of the author. Yet, as
if to show that he could take pains if he liked, the quotations
from Scripture are on the whole correctly transcribed
and show very few variations from the received versions.
Consequently when such variations do occur (they are
noted later whenever met with), we must suppose them to
be not the work of Hippolytus, but of the heretics from
whom he quotes, who must, therefore, have taken liberties
with the New Testament similar to those of Marcion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Where, also, he copies Irenæus with or without acknowledgment,
his copy is extremely faithful, and agrees with the
Latin version of the model more closely than the Greek
of Epiphanius. It would seem, therefore, that our author’s
statements, although in no sense unworthy of belief, yet
require in many cases strict examination before they can
be unhesitatingly accepted.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>


<h3 id="IN_4">4. <span class="smcap">The Composition of the Work</span></h3>

<p>In these circumstances, and in view of the manifest discrepancies
between statements in the earlier part of the text
and what purports to be their repetition in the later, the
question has naturally arisen as to whether the document
before us was written for publication in its present form.
It is never referred to or quoted by name by any later
author, and although the argument from silence has
generally proved a broken reed in such cases, there are here
some circumstances which seem to give it unusual strength.
It was certainly no reluctance to call in evidence the work
of a schismatic or heretical writer which led to the work
being ignored, for Epiphanius, a century and a half later,
classes Hippolytus with Irenæus and Clement of Alexandria
as one from whose writings he has obtained information,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
and Theodoret, while making use still later of certain
passages which coincide with great closeness with some in
Book X of our text,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> admits, as has been said, Hippolytus’
claim to both episcopacy and martyrdom. But the passages
in Theodoret which seem to show borrowing from Hippolytus,
although possibly, are not necessarily from the work
before us. The author of this tells us in Book I that he
has “aforetime”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> expounded the tenets of the heretics
“within measure,” and without revealing all their mysteries,
and it might, therefore, be from some such earlier work
that both Epiphanius and Theodoret have borrowed. Some
writers, including Salmon,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> have thought that this earlier
work of our author is to be found in the anonymous tractate
<i>Adversus Omnes Hæreses</i> usually appended to Tertullian’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
works.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Yet this tractate, which is extremely short, contains
nothing that can be twisted into the words common
to our text and to Theodoret, and we might, therefore, assert
with confidence that it was from our text that Theodoret
copied them but for the fact that he nowhere indicates their
origin. This might be only another case of the unacknowledged
borrowing much in fashion in his time, were it not
that Theodoret has already spoken of Hippolytus in the
eulogistic terms quoted above, and would therefore, one
would think, have been glad to give as his informant such
respectable authority. As he did not do so, we may perhaps
accept the conclusion drawn by Cruice with much
skill in a study published shortly after the appearance of
Miller’s text,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and say with him that Theodoret did not
know that the passages in question were to be found in
any work of Hippolytus. In this case, as the statements
in Book IX forbid us to suppose that our text was published
anonymously or pseudonymously, the natural inference is
that both Hippolytus and Theodoret drew from a common
source.</p>

<p>What this source was likely to have been there can be
little doubt. Our author speaks more than once of “the
blessed elder Irenæus,” who has, he says, refuted the heretic
Marcus with much vigour, and he implies that the energy
and power displayed by Irenæus in such matters have
shortened his own work with regard to the Valentinian
school generally.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Photius, also, writing as has been said
in the ninth century, mentions a work of Hippolytus against
heresies admittedly owing much to Irenæus’ instruction.
The passage runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot nsize">

<p>“A booklet of Hippolytus has been read. Now
Hippolytus was a disciple of Irenæus. But it (i. e.
the booklet) was the compilation against 32 heresies
making (the) Dositheans the beginning (of them) and
comprising (those) up to Noetus and the Noetians.
And he says that these heresies were subjected to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
refutations by Irenæus in conversation<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> (or in lectures).
Of which refutations making also a synopsis, he says
he compiled this book. The phrasing however is
clear, reverent and unaffected, although he does not
observe the Attic style. But he says some other things
lacking in accuracy, and that the Epistle to the Hebrews
was not by the Apostle Paul.”</p></div>

<p>These words have been held by Salmon and others to
describe the tractate <i>Adversus Omnes Hæreses</i>. Yet this
tractate contains not thirty-two heresies, but twenty-seven,
and begins with Simon Magus to end with the Praxeas against
whom Tertullian wrote. It also notices another heretic named
Blastus, who, like Praxeas, is mentioned neither by Irenæus
nor by our author, nor does it say anything about Noetus
or the Apostle Paul. It does indeed mention at the outset
“Dositheus the Samaritan,” but only to say that the author
proposes to keep silence concerning both him and the Jews,
and “to turn to those who have wished to make heresy
from the Gospel,” the very first of whom, he says, is Simon
Magus.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> As for refutations, the tractate contains nothing
resembling one, which has forced the supporters of the
theory to assume that they were omitted for brevity’s sake.
Nor does it in the least agree with our text in its description
of the tenets and practices of heresies which the two documents
treat of in common, such as Simon, Basilides, the
Sethiani and others, and the differences are too great to be
accounted for by supposing that the author of the later text
was merely incorporating in it newer information.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, Photius’ description agrees fairly well
with our text, which contains thirty-one heresies all told, or
thirty-two if we include, as the author asks us to do, that imputed
by him to Callistus. Of these, that of Noetus is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
twenty-eighth, and is followed by those of the Elchesaites,
Essenes, Pharisees and Sadducees only. These four last are
all much earlier in date than any mentioned in the rest of the
work, and three of them appeared to the author of the tractate
last quoted as not heresies at all, while the fourth is not described
by him, and there is no reason immediately apparent
why in any case they should be put after and not before the
post-Christian ones. The early part of the summary of Jewish
beliefs in Book X is torn away, and may have contained a
notice of Dositheus, whose name occurs in Eusebius and
other writers,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> as a predecessor of Simon Magus and one
who did not believe in the inspiration of the Jewish
Prophets. The natural place in chronological order for
these Jewish and Samaritan sects would, therefore, be at the
head rather than at the tail of the list, and if we may venture
to put them there and to restore to the catalogue the name
of Dositheus, we should have our thirty-two heresies,
beginning with Dositheus and ending with Noetus. We
will return later to the reason why Photius should call
our text a Biblidarion or “booklet.”</p>

<p>Are there now any reasons for thinking that our text is
founded on such a synopsis of lectures as Photius says
Hippolytus made? A fairly cogent one is the inconvenient
and awkward division of the books, which often seem as if
they had been arranged to occupy equal periods of time in
delivery. Another is the unnecessary and tedious introductions
and recapitulations with which the descriptions
of particular philosophies, charlatanic practices, and heresies
begin and end, and which seem as if they were only
put in for the sake of arresting or holding the attention of
an audience addressed verbally. Thus, in the account of
Simon Magus’ heresy, our author begins with a long-winded
story of a Libyan who taught parrots to proclaim his own
divinity, the only bearing of which upon the story of Simon
is that Hippolytus asserts, like Justin Martyr, that Simon
wished his followers to take him for the Supreme Being.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
So, too, he begins the succeeding book with the age-worn
tale of Ulysses and the Sirens<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> by way of introduction to
the tenets of Basilides, with which it has no connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
whatever. This was evidently intended to attract the
attention of an audience so as to induce them to give more
heed to the somewhat intricate details which follow. In
other cases, he puts at the beginning or end of a book
a more or less detailed summary of those which preceded
it, lest, as he states in one instance, his hearers should have
forgotten what he has before said.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> These are the usual
artifices of a lecturer, but a more salient example is perhaps
those ends of chapters giving indications of what is to follow
immediately, which can hardly be anything else than
announcements in advance of the subject of the next
lecture. Thus, at the end of Book I, he promises to
explain the mystic rites<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>&mdash;a promise which is for us unfulfilled
in the absence of Books II and III; at the end of
Book IV, he tells us that he will deal with the disciples of
Simon and Valentinus<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>; at that of Book VII, that he will
do the same with the Docetæ<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>; and at that of Book VIII
that he will “pass on” to the heresy of Noetus.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In none
of these cases does he more than mention the first of the
heresies to be treated of in the succeeding book, which the
reader could find out for himself by turning over the page,
or rather by casting his eye a little further down the roll.</p>

<p>Again, there are repetitions in our text excusable in a
lecturer who does not, if he is wise, expect his hearers to
have at their fingers’ ends all that he has said in former
lectures, and who may even find that he can best root
things in their memory by saying them over and over
again; but quite unpardonable in a writer who can refer
his readers more profitably to his former statements. Yet,
we find our author in Book I giving us the supposed teaching
of Pythagoras as to the monad being a male member,
the dyad a female and so on up to the decad, which is
supposed to be perfect.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This is gone through all over
again in Book IV with reference to the art of arithmetic<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
and again in Book VI where it is made a sort of shoeing-horn
to the Valentinian heresy<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>. The same may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
said of the “Categories” or accidents of substance which
Hippolytus in one place attributes to Pythagoras, but which
are identical with those set out by Aristotle in the <i>Organon</i>.
He gives them rightly to Aristotle in Book I, but makes
them the invention of the Pythagoreans in Book VI only to
return them to Aristotle in Book VII.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Here again is a
mistake such as a lecturer might make by a slip of the
tongue, but not a writer with any pretensions to care or
seriousness.</p>

<p>Beyond this, there is some little direct evidence of a
lecture origin for our text. In his comments on the system
of Justinus, which he connects with the Ophites, our author
says: “Though I have met with many heresies, O beloved,
I have met with none viler in evil than this.” The word
“beloved” is here in the plural, and would be the phrase
used by a Greek-speaking person in a lecture to a class or
group of disciples or catechumens.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> I do not think there
is any instance of its use in a <i>book</i>. In another place he
says that his “discourse” has proved useful, not only for
refuting heretics, but for combating the prevalent belief in
astrology;<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and although the word might be employed by
other authors with regard to writings, yet it is not likely to
have been used in that sense by Hippolytus, who everywhere
possible refers to his former “books.” There is,
therefore, a good deal of reason for supposing that some
part of this work first saw the light as spoken and not as
written words.</p>

<p>What this part is may be difficult to define with great
exactness; but there are abundant signs that the work as
we have it was not written all at one time. In Book I, the
author expresses his intention of assigning every heresy
to the speculations of some particular philosopher or
philosophic school.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> So far from doing so, however, he
only compares Valentinus with Pythagoras and Plato,
Basilides with Aristotle, Cerdo and Marcion with Empedocles,
Hermogenes with Socrates, and Noetus with
Heraclitus, leaving all the Ophite teachers, Satornilus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Carpocrates, Cerinthus and other founders of schools
without a single philosopher attached to them. At the end
of Book IV, moreover, he draws attention more than once
to certain supposed resemblances in the views linked with
the name of Pythagoras, to those underlying the nomenclature
of the Simonian and Valentinian heresies, and
concludes with the words that he must proceed to the
doctrines of these last.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Before he does so, however,
Book V is interposed and is entirely taken up with the
Ophites, or worshippers of the Serpent, to whom he does
not attempt to assign a philosophic origin. In Book VI
he carries out his promise in Book IV by going at length
into the doctrines of Simon, Valentinus and the followers
of this last, and in Book VII he takes us in like manner
through those of Basilides, Menander, Marcion and his
successors, Carpocrates, Cerinthus and many others of the
less-known heresiarchs. Book VIII deals in the same way
with a sect that he calls the Docetæ, Monoimus the
Arabian, Tatian, Hermogenes and some others. In the
case of the Ophite teachers, Simon, and Basilides, he gives
us, as has been said, extracts from documents which are
entirely new to us, and were certainly not used by Irenæus,
while he adds to the list of heresies described by his
predecessor, the sects of the Docetæ, Monoimus and the
Quartodecimans. In all the other heresies so far, he
follows Irenæus’ account almost word for word, and with
such closeness as enables us to restore in great part the
missing Greek text of that Father. With Book IX, however,
there comes a change. Mindful of the intention
expressed in Book I, he here begins with a summary of the
teaching of Heraclitus the Obscure, which no one has yet
professed to understand, and then sets to work to deduce
from it the heresy of Noetus. This gives him the opportunity
for the virulent attack on his rival Callistus, to
whom he ascribes a modification of Noetus’ heresy, and he
next, as has been said, plunges into a description of the
sect of the Elchesaites, then only lately come to Rome, and
quotes from Josephus without acknowledgment and with
some garbling the account by this last of the division of the
Jews into the three sects of Pharisees, Sadducees and Essenes.
Noetus’ heresy was what was known as Patripassian, from its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
involving the admission that the Father suffered upon the
Cross, and although he manages to see Gnostic elements in
that of the Elchesaites, there can be little doubt that these
last-named “heretics,” whose main tenet was the prescription
of frequent baptism for all sins and diseases, were
connected with the pre-Christian sect of Hemerobaptists,
Mogtasilah or “Washers” who are at once pre-Christian,
and still to be found near the Tigris between Baghdad and
Basra. Why he should have added to these the doctrines
of the Jews is uncertain, as the obvious place for this would
have been, as has been said, at the beginning of the
volume:<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> but a possible explanation is that he was here
resuming a course of instruction by lectures that he had
before abandoned, and was therefore in some sort obliged to
spin it out to a certain length.</p>

<p>Book X seems at first sight likely to solve many of the
questions which every reader who has got so far is
compelled to ask. It begins, in accordance with the habit
just noted, with the statement that the author has now
worked through “the Labyrinth of Heresies” and that the
teachings of truth are to be found neither in the philosophies
of the Greeks, the secret mysteries of the Egyptians,
the formulas of the Chaldæans or astrologers, nor the ravings
of Babylonian magic.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> This links it with fair closeness to
the reference in Book IV to the ideas of the Persians,
Babylonians, Egyptians and Chaldæans, only the first-named
nation being here omitted from the text. It then goes on
to say that “having brought together the opinions<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> of all
the wise men among the <i>Greeks</i> in four books and those of
the heresiarchs in five,” he will make a summary of them. It
will be noted that this is in complete contradiction to the
supposition that the missing Books II and III contained
the doctrines of the Babylonians, as he now says that they
comprised those of the Greeks only. The summary which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
follows might have been expected to make this confusion
clear, but unfortunately it does nothing of the kind. It
does indeed give so good an abstract of what has been said
in Books V to IX inclusive regarding the chief heresiarchs,
that in one or two places it enables us to correct doubtful
phrases and to fill in gaps left in earlier books. There is
omitted from the summary, however, all mention of the
heresies of Marcus, Satornilus, Menander, Carpocrates, the
Nicolaitans, Docetæ, Quartodecimans, Encratites and the
Jewish sects, and the list of omissions will probably be
thought too long to be accounted for on the ground of
mere carelessness. But when the summarizer deals with
the earlier books, the discrepancy between the summary
and the documents summarized is much more startling.
Among the philosophers, he omits to summarize the
opinions of Pythagoras, Empedocles, Ecphantus, Hippo,
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Academics, Brachmans,
or Druids, while he does mention those of
Hippasus, Ocellus Lucanus, Heraclides of Pontus and
Asclepiades, who were not named in any of the texts of
Book I which have come down to us. As for the tenets
and practices of the Persians, Egyptians and others,
supposed on the strength of the statement at the beginning
of Book V to have been narrated in Books II and III,
nothing further is here said concerning them, and, by the
little table of contents with which Book X like the others is
prefaced, it will appear that nothing was intended to be
said. For this last omission it might be possible to assign
plausible reasons if it stood alone; but when it is coupled
with the variations between summary and original as
regards Book I, the only inference that meets all the facts
is that the summarizer did not have the first four books
under his eyes.</p>

<p>This has led some critics to conclude that the summary
is by another hand. There is nothing in the literary
manners of the age to compel us to reject this supposition,
and similar cases have been quoted. The evidence of style
is, however, against it, and it is unlikely that if the
summarizer were any other person than Hippolytus, he
would have taken up Hippolytus’ personal quarrel against
Callistus. Yet in the text of Book X before us the charge of
heresy against Callistus is repeated, although perhaps with less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
asperity than in Book IX, the accusations against his
morals being omitted. Nor is it easy to dissociate from
Hippolytus the really eloquent appeal to men of all nations
to escape the terrors of Tartarus and gain an immortality of
bliss by becoming converted to the Doctrine of Truth with
which the Book ends, after an excursion into Hebrew
Chronology, a subject which always had great fascination
for Hippolytus. Although the matter is not beyond doubt,
it would appear, therefore, that the summary, like the rest
of the book, is by Hippolytus’ own hand.</p>

<p>In these circumstances there is but one theory that in the
opinion of the present writer will reconcile all the conflicting
facts. This is that the foundation of our text <i>is</i> the synopsis
that Hippolytus made, as Photius tells us, after receiving
instruction from Irenæus; that those notes were, as Hippolytus
himself says, “set forth” by him possibly in the form of
lectures, equally possibly in writing, but in any case a long
time before our text was compiled; and that when his
rivalry with Callistus became acute, he thought of republishing
these discourses and bringing them up to date by adding
to them the Noetian and other non-Gnostic heresies which
were then making headway among the Christian community,
together with the facts about the divinatory and magical
tricks which had come to his knowledge during his long
stay in Rome. We may next conjecture that, after the
greater part of his book was written, chance threw in his
way the documents belonging to the Naassene and other
Ophite sects, which went back to the earliest days of
Christianity and were probably in Hippolytus’ time on the
verge of extinction.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> He had before determined to omit
these sects as of slight importance,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but now perceiving the
interest of the new documents, he hastily incorporated them
in his book immediately after his account of the magicians,
so that they might appear as what he with some truth said
they were, to wit, the fount and source of all later Gnosticism.
To do this, he had to displace the account of the Jewish
and Samaritan sects with which all the heresiologists of the
time thought it necessary to begin their histories. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
probably felt the less reluctance in doing so, because the
usual mention of these sects as “heresies” in some sort
contradicted his pet theory, which was that the Gnostic
tenets were not a mere perversion of Christian teaching, but
were derived from philosophic theories of the creation of
things, and from the mystic rites.</p>

<p>Next let us suppose that at the close of his life, when he
was perhaps hiding from Maximin’s inquisitors, or even
when he was at the Sardinian mines, he thought of preserving
his work for posterity by re-writing it&mdash;such copies
as he had left behind him in Rome having been doubtless
seized by the Imperial authorities.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Not having the material
that he had before used then at his disposal, he had to
make the best summary that he could from memory, and
in the course of this found that the contents of the Books
I, II, and III&mdash;the material for which he had drawn in the
first instance from Irenæus&mdash;had more or less escaped him.
He was probably able to recall some part of Book I by the
help of heathen works like those of Diogenes Laertius,
Aetius, or perhaps that Alcinous whose summary of Plato’s
doctrines seem to have been formerly used by him.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The
Ophite and other Gnostic heresies he remembers sufficiently
to make his summary of their doctrines more easy, although
he omits from the list heresiarchs like Marcus, Satornilus
and Menander, about whom he had never had any exclusive
information, and he now puts Justinus after instead of before
Basilides. Finally, he remembered the Jewish sects which
he had once intended to include, and being perhaps able
to command, even in the mines, the work of a Romanized
but unconverted Jew like Josephus, took from it such facts
as seemed useful for his purpose as an introduction to the
chronological speculation which had once formed his
favourite study. With this summary as his guide he
continued, it may be, to warn the companions in adversity
to whom he tells us he had “become an adviser,” against
the perils of heresy, and to appeal to his unconverted
listeners with what his former translator calls not unfitly “a
noble specimen of patristic eloquence.” That he died in
the mines is most probable, not only from his advanced age<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
at the time of exile and the consequent unlikelihood that
he would be able to withstand the pestilential climate, but
also from the record of his body having been “deposited”
in the Catacombs on the same day with that of his fellow-Pope
and martyr Pontianus.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Yet the persecution of
Maximin, though sharp, was short, and on the death of
the tyrant after a reign of barely three years, there is no
reason why the transcript of Book X should not have
reached Rome, where there is some reason to think it was
known from its opening words as “the Labyrinth.” Later
it was probably appended to Books IV to IX of Hippolytus’
better known work, and the whole copied for the use of
those officials who had to enquire into heresy. To them,
Books II and III would be useless, and they probably
thought it inexpedient to perpetuate any greater knowledge
than was necessary for their better suppression, of the
unclean mysteries of either pagan or Gnostic. As for
Book I, besides being harmless, it had possibly by that time
become too firmly connected with the name of Origen for
its attribution to this other sufferer in the Maximinian
persecution to be disturbed in later times.</p>

<p>It only remains to see how this theory fits in with the
remarks of Photius given above. It is fairly evident that
Photius is speaking from recollection only, and that the
words do not suggest that he had Hippolytus’ actual work
before him when writing, while he throughout speaks of it
in the past tense as one might speak of a document which
has long since perished, although some memory of its
contents have been preserved. If this were so, we might
be prepared to take Photius’ description as not necessarily
accurate in every detail; yet, as we have it, it is almost a
perfect description of our text. The 32 heresies, as we
have shown above, appear in our text as in Photius’ document.
Our text contains not only the large excerpts from
Irenæus which we might expect from Photius’ account of
its inception, but also the “refutations” which do not appear
in the <i>Adversus Omnes Hæreses</i>. It extends “up to,” as
Photius says, Noetus and the Noetians, and although it
does not contain any mention of Dositheus or the
Dositheans, this may have been given in the part which has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
been cut out of Book X.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> If that were the case, or if
Photius has made any mistake in the matter, as one might
easily do when we consider that all the early heresiologies
begin with Jewish and Samaritan sects, the only real
discrepancy between our text and Photius’ description of
Hippolytus’ work is in the matter of length. But it is by
no means certain that Photius ever saw the whole work put
together, and it is plain that he had never seen or had
forgotten the first four books dealing with the philosophers,
the mysteries and the charlatans. Without these, and
without the summary, Books V to IX do not work out to
more than 70,000 words in all, and this might well seem
a mere “booklet” to a man then engaged in the compilation
of his huge <i>Bibliotheca</i>. Whether, then, Hippolytus did or
did not reduce to writing the exposition of heresies which
he made in his youth, it seems probable that all certain trace
of this exposition is lost. It is certainly not to be recognized
in pseudo-Tertullian’s <i>Adversus Omnes Hæreses</i>, and the
work of Hippolytus recorded by Photius was probably a
copy of our text in a more or less complete form.</p>


<h3 id="IN_5">5. <span class="smcap">The Style of the Work</span></h3>

<p>Photius’ remark that Hippolytus did not keep to the
Attic style is an understatement of the case with regard to
our text. Jacobi, its first critic, was so struck by the
number of “Latinisms” that he found in it as to conjecture
that it is nothing but a Greek translation of a Latin original.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
This is so unlikely as to be well-nigh impossible if Hippolytus
were indeed the author; and no motive for such
translation can be imagined unless it were made at a fairly
late period. In that case, we should expect to find it full
of words and expressions used only in Byzantine times
when the Greek language had become debased by Slav and
Oriental admixtures. This, however, is not the case with
our text, and only one distinctly Byzantine phrase has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
rewarded a careful search.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> On the other hand neologisms
are not rare, especially in Book X,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and everything goes
to show the truth of Cruice’s remark that the author was
evidently not a trained writer. This is by no means inconsistent
with the theory that the whole work is by Hippolytus,
and is the more probable if we conclude that it was originally
spoken instead of written.</p>

<p>This is confirmed when we look into the construction of
the author’s sentences. They are drawn out by a succession
of relative clauses to an extent very rare among even late
Greek writers, more than one sentence covering 20 or 30
lines of the printed page without a full stop, while the
usual rules as to the place and order of the words are often
neglected. Another peculiarity of style is the constant
piling up of several similes or tropes where only one would
suffice, which is very distinctly marked in the passages
whenever the author is speaking for long in his own person
and without quoting the words of another. In all these
we seem to be listening to the words of a fluent but rather
laborious orator. Thus in Book I he compares the joy
that he expects to find in his work to that of an athlete
gaining the crown, of a merchant selling his goods after a
long voyage, of a husbandsman with his hardly won crops,
and of a despised prophet seeing his predictions fulfilled.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
So in Book V, after mentioning a book by Orpheus called
<i>Bacchica</i> otherwise unknown, he goes on to speak of “the
mystic rite of Celeus and Triptolemus and Demeter and
Core and Dionysus in Eleusis,”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> when any practised writer
would have said the Eleusinian mysteries simply. A similar
piling up of imagery is found in Book VIII, where he
speaks of the seed of the fig-tree as “a refuge for the
terror-stricken, a shelter for the naked, a veil for modesty,
and the sought-for produce to which the Lord came in
search of fruit three times and found none.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> But it is
naturally in the phrases of the pastoral address with which
Book X ends that the most salient examples occur. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the unconverted are told that by being instructed in the
knowledge of the true God, they will escape the imminent
menace of the judgment fire, and the unillumined vision of
gloomy Tartarus, and the burning of the everlasting shore
of the Gehenna of fire, and the eye of the Tartaruchian
angels in eternal punishment, and the worm that ever coils
as if for food round the body whence it was bred,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>&mdash;or, as he
might have said in one word, the horrors of hell.</p>

<p>Less distinctive than this, although equally noticeable, is
the play of words which is here frequently employed.
This is not unknown among other ecclesiastical writers of
the time, and seems to have struck Charles Kingsley when,
fresh from a perusal of St. Augustine, he describes him as
“by a sheer mistranslation” twisting one of the Psalms to
mean what it never meant in the writer’s mind, and what
it never could mean, and then punning on the Latin
version.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Hippolytus when writing in his own person
makes but moderate use of this figure. Sometimes he does
so legitimately enough, as when he speaks of the Gnostics
initiating a convert into their systems and delivering to
him “the perfection of wickedness”&mdash;the word used for
perfection having the mystic or technical meaning of initiation
as well as the more ordinary one of completion<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>; or
when he says that the measurements of stellar distances by
Ptolemy have led to the construction of measureless
“heresies.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> At others he consciously puns on the double
meaning of a word, as when he says that those who venture
upon orgies are not far from the wrath (ὀργή) of God.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Sometimes, again, he is led away by a merely accidental
similarity of sounds as when he tries to connect the name of
the Docetæ, which he knows is taken from δοκεῖν, “to seem,”
with “the <i>beam</i> (δοκός) in the eye” of the Sermon on the
Mount.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> He makes a second and more obvious pun on
the same word later when he says that the Docetæ do more
than <i>seem</i> to be mad; but he is most shameless when he
derives “prophet” from προφαίνειν instead of πρόφημι<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>&mdash;a
perversion which one can hardly imagine entering into the
head of any one with the most modest acquaintance with
Greek grammar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>But these puns, bad as they are, are venial compared
with some of the authors from whom he quotes. None
can equal in this respect the efforts of the Naassene author,
whose plays upon words and audacious derivations might
put to the blush those in the <i>Cratylus</i>. Adamas and Adam,
Corybas and κορυφή (the head), Geryon and Γηρυόνην
(“flowing from earth”), Mesopotamia and “a river from the
middle,” Papas and παῦε, παῦε (“Cease! cease!”), Αἰπόλος
(“goat herd”) and ἀεὶ πολῶν (“ever turning”), <i>naas</i>
(“serpent”) and ναός (“temple”), Euphrates and εὐφραίνει
(“he rejoices”) are but a few of the terrible puns he
perpetrates.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The Peratic author is more sober in this
respect, and yet he, or perhaps Hippolytus for him, derives
the name of the sect from περᾶν (“to pass beyond”),<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
although Theodoret with more plausibility would take it
from the nationality of its teacher Euphrates the Peratic or
Mede; and the chapter on the Sethians does not contain a
single pun. Yet that on Justinus makes up for this by
deriving the name of the god Priapus from πριοποιέω, a word
made up for the occasion.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> “The great Gnostics of
Hadrian’s time,” viz.:&mdash;Basilides, Marcion and Valentinus,
seem to have had souls above such puerilities; but the
Docetic author resumes the habit with a specially daring
parallel between Βάτος (“a bush”) and βάτος (Hera’s robe
or “mist”)<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and Monoimus the Arab follows suit with a
sort of jingle between the Decalogue and the δεκάπληγος or
ten plagues of Egypt, which would hardly have occurred to
any one without the Semitic taste for assonance.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Of the
less-quoted writers there is no occasion to speak, because
there are either no extracts from their works given in our
text or they are too short for us to judge from them
whether they, too, were given to punning.</p>

<p>Apart from such comparatively small matters, however,
the difference in style between the several Gnostic writers
here quoted is well marked. Nothing can be more singular
at first sight than the way in which the Naassene author
expresses himself. It seems to the reader on the first
perusal of his lucubrations as if the writer had made up his
mind to follow no train of thought beyond the limits of a
single sentence. Beginning with the idea of the First Man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
which we find running like a thread through so many
Eastern creeds, from that of the Cabalists among the Jews
to the Manichæans who perhaps took it directly from its
primitive source in Babylon,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> he immediately turns from
this to declare the tripartite division of the universe and
everything it contains, including the souls and natures of
men, and to inculcate the strictest asceticism. Yet all this
is written round, so to speak, a hymn to Attis which he
declares relates to the Mysteries of the Mother with several
allusions to the most secret rites of the Eleusinian Demeter
and, as it would appear, of those of the Greek Isis. The
Peratic author, on the other hand, also teaches a tripartite
division of things and souls, but draws his proofs not from
the same mystic sources as the Naassene but from what
Hippolytus declares to be the system of the astrologers.
This system, which is not even hinted at in any avowedly
astrological work, is that the stars are the cause of all that
happens here below, and that we can only escape from
their sway into one of the two worlds lying above ours by
the help of Christ, here called the Perfect Serpent, existing
as an intermediary between the Father of All and Matter.
Yet this doctrine, which we can also read without much
forcing of the text into the rhapsody of the Naassene, is
stated with all the precision and sobriety of a scientific
proposition, and is as entirely free from the fervour and
breathlessness of the last-named writer as it is from his
perpetual allusions to the Greek and especially to the
Alexandrian and Anatolian mythology.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Both these again
are perfectly different in style from the “Sethian” author
from whom Hippolytus gives us long extracts, and who
seems to have trusted mainly to an imagery which is entirely
opposed to all Western conventions of modesty.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Yet all
three aver the strongest belief in the Divinity and Divine
Mission of Jesus, whom they identify with the Good Serpent,
which was according to many modern authors the chief
material object of adoration in every heathen temple in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
Asia Minor.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> They are, therefore, rightly numbered by
Hippolytus among the Ophite heresies, and seem to be
founded upon traditions current throughout Western Asia
which even now are not perhaps quite extinct. Yet each
of the three authors quoted in our text writes in a perfectly
different style from his two fellow heresiarchs, and this
alone is sufficient to remove all doubt as to the genuineness
of the document.</p>

<p>These three Ophite chapters are taken first because in
our text they begin the heresiology strictly so called.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> As
has been said, the present writer believes them to be an
interpolation made at the last moment by the author, and
by no means the most valuable, though they are perhaps
the most curious part of the book. They resemble much,
however, in thought the quotations in our text attributed
to Simon Magus, and although the ideas apparent in them
differ in material points, yet there seems to be between the
two sets of documents a kind of family likeness in the
occasional use of bombastic language and unclean imagery.
But when we turn from these to the extracts from the works
attributed to Valentinus and Basilides which Hippolytus
gives us, a change is immediately apparent. Here we have
dignity of language corresponding to dignity of thought, and
in the case of Valentinus especially the diction is quite equal
to the passages from the discourses of that most eloquent
heretic quoted by Clement of Alexandria. We feel on reading
them that we have indeed travelled from the Orontes to
the Tiber, and the difference in style should by itself
convince the most sceptical critic at once of the good
faith of our careless author and of the authenticity of the
sources from which he has collected his information.</p>


<h3 id="IN_6">6. <span class="smcap">The Value of the Work</span></h3>

<p>What interest has a work such as this of Hippolytus for
us at the present day? In the first place it preserves for
us many precious relics of a literature which before its discovery
seemed lost for ever. The pagan hymn to Attis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
and the Gnostic one on the Divine Mission of Jesus, both
appearing in Book V, are finds of the highest value for the
study of the religious beliefs of the early centuries of our
Era, and with these go many fragments of hardly less importance,
including the Pindaric ode in the same book.
Not less useful or less unexpected are the revelations in the
same book of the true meaning of the syncretistic worship
of Attis and Cybele, and the disclosure here made of the
supreme mystery of the Eleusinian rites, which we now
know for the first time culminated in the representation of
a divine marriage and of the subsequent birth of an infant
god, coupled with the symbolical display of an “ear of corn
reaped in silence.” For the study of classical antiquity as
well as for the science of religions such facts are of the
highest value.</p>

<p>But all this will for most of us yield in interest to the
picture which our text gives us of the struggles of Christianity
against its external and internal foes during the first
three centuries. So far from this period having been one
of quiet growth and development for the infant Church, we
see her in Hippolytus’ pages exposed not only to fierce if
sporadic persecution from pagan emperors, but also to the
steady and persistent rivalry of scores of competing schools
led by some of the greatest minds of the age, and all combining
some of the main tenets of Christianity with the
relics of heathenism. We now know, too, that she was not
always able to present an unbroken front to these violent
or insidious assailants. In the highest seats of the Church,
as we now learn for the first time, there were divisions on
matters of faith which anticipated in some measure those
which nearly rent her in twain after the promulgation of
the Creed of Nicæa. Such a schism as that between the
churches of Hippolytus and Callistus must have given
many an opportunity to those foes who were in some sort
of her own household; while round the contest, like the
irregular auxiliaries of a regular army, swarmed a crowd of
wonder-workers, diviners, and other exploiters of the public
credulity, of whose doings we have before gained some
insight from writers like Lucian and Apuleius, but whose
methods and practices are for the first time fully described
by Hippolytus.</p>

<p>The conversion of the whole Empire under Constantine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
broke once for all the power of these enemies of the Church.
Schisms were still to occur, but grievous as they were, they
happily proved impotent to destroy the essential unity of
Christendom. The heathen faiths and the Gnostic sects
derived from them were soon to wither like plants that had
no root, and both they and the charlatans whose doings
our author details were relentlessly hunted down by the
State which had once given them shelter: while if the means
used for this purpose were not such as the purer Christian
ethics would now approve, we must remember that these
means would probably have proved ineffective had not
Christian teaching already destroyed the hold of these
older beliefs on the seething populations of the Empire.
That the adolescent Church should thus have been enabled
to triumph over all her enemies may seem to many a
better proof of her divine guidance than the miraculous
powers once attributed to her. We may not all of us be
able to believe that a rainstorm put out the fire on which
Thekla was to be burned alive, or that the crocodiles in the
tank in the arena into which she was cast were struck by
lightning and floated to the surface dead.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Still less can
we credit that the portraits of St. Theodore and other
military saints left their place in the palace of the Queen of
Persia and walked about in human form.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Such stories
are for the most of us either pious fables composed for
edification or half-forgotten records of natural events seen
through the mist of exaggeration and misrepresentation
common in the Oriental mind. But that the Church which
began like a grain of mustard seed should in so short a time
come to overshadow the whole civilized world may well
seem when we consider the difficulties in her way a greater
miracle than any of those recorded in the Apocryphal
Gospels and Acts; and the full extent of these difficulties
we should not have known save for Mynas’ discovery of our
text.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="sidenote">p. 1,<br />Cruice.</span><span class="smcap">These</span> are the contents<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the First Part<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the Refutation
of all Heresies;</p>

<p>What were the tenets of the natural philosophers and who
these were; and what those of the ethicists and who these
were; and what those of the dialecticians and who the
dialecticians were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Now the natural philosophers mentioned are Thales,
Pythagoras, Empedocles, Heraclitus, Anaximander,
Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, Parmenides,
Leucippus, Democritus, Xenophanes, Ecphantus, and
<span class="sidenote">p. 2.</span>
Hippo. The ethicists are Socrates, pupil of Archelaus
the physicist and Plato, pupil of Socrates. These mingled
together the three kinds of philosophy. The dialecticians
are Aristotle, pupil of Plato and the founder of dialectics,
and the Stoics Chrysippus and Zeno.</p>

<p>Epicurus, however, maintained an opinion almost exactly
contrary to all these. So did Pyrrho the Academic<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> who
asserts the incomprehensibility of all things. There are
also the Brachmans<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> among the Indians, the Druids
among the Celts, and Hesiod.</p>


<h3 id="I_0">(PROÆMIUM)</h3>

<p>No fable made famous by the Greeks is to be neglected.
For even those opinions of theirs which lack consistency
are believed through the extravagant madness of the
heretics, who, from hiding in silence their own unspeakable
mysteries, are supposed by many to worship God. Whose
opinions also we aforetime set forth within measure, not
displaying them in detail but refuting them in the rough,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
as we did not hold it fit to bring their unspeakable deeds
<span class="sidenote">p. 3.</span>
to light. This we did that, as we set forth their tenets
by hints only, they, becoming ashamed lest by telling
outright their secrets we should prove them to be godless,
might abate somewhat from their unreasoned purpose and
unlawful enterprise.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But since I see that they have not
been put to shame by our clemency, and have not considered
God’s long-suffering under their blasphemies, I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
forced, in order that they may either be shamed into
repentance, or remaining as they are may be rightly judged,
to proceed to show their ineffable mysteries which they
impart to those candidates for initiation who are thoroughly
trustworthy. Yet they do not previously avow them, unless
they have enslaved such a one by keeping him long
in suspense and preparing him by blasphemy against
the true God,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and they see him longing for the jugglery of
the disclosure. And then, when they have proved him
to be bound fast by iniquity,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> they initiate him and impart
to him the perfection of evil things,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> first binding him
by oath neither to tell nor to impart them to any one unless
he too has been enslaved in the same way. Yet from him
to whom they have been only communicated, no oath is
<span class="sidenote">p. 4.</span>
longer necessary. For whoso has submitted to learn and to
receive their final mysteries will by the act itself and by his
own conscience be bound not to utter them to others. For
were he to declare to any man such an offence, he would
neither be reckoned longer among men, nor thought
worthy any more to behold the light. Which things also are
such an offence that even the dumb animals do not attempt
them, as we shall say in its place.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But since the
argument compels us to enter into the case very deeply,
we do not think fit to hold our peace, but setting forth
in detail the opinions of all, we shall keep silence on none.
And it seems good to us to spare no labour even if thereby
the tale be lengthened. For we shall leave behind us
no small help to the life of men against further error, when
all see clearly the hidden and unspeakable orgies of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
the heretics are the stewards and which they impart only to
the initiated. But none other will refute these things than
the Holy Spirit handed down in the Church which the
Apostles having first received did distribute to those who
rightly believed. Whose successors we chance to be and
partakers of the same grace of high priesthood<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and of
<span class="sidenote">p. 5.</span>
teaching and accounted guardians of the Church. Wherefore
we close not our eyes nor abstain from straight speech;
but neither do we tire in working with our whole soul and
body worthily to return worthy service to the beneficent
God. Nor do we make full return save that we slacken not
in that which is entrusted to us; but we fill full the measures
of our opportunity and without envy communicate to all
whatsoever the Holy Spirit shall provide. Thus we not
only bring into the open by refutation the affairs of the
enemy;<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but also whatever the truth has received by the
Father’s grace and ministered to men. These things
we preach<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> as one who is not ashamed, both interpreting
them by discourse and making them to bear witness by
writings.</p>

<p>In order then, as we have said by anticipation, that
we may show these men to be godless alike in purpose,
character and deed, and from what source their schemes
have come&mdash;and because they have in their attempts taken
nothing from the Holy Scriptures, nor is it from guarding
the succession of any saint that they have been hurried into
<span class="sidenote">p. 6.</span>
these things, but their theories<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> take their origin from the
wisdom of the Greeks, from philosophizing opinions,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> from
would-be mysteries and from wandering astrologers&mdash;it
seems then proper that we first set forth the tenets of the
philosophers of the Greeks and point out to our readers<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
which of them are the oldest and most reverent towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
the Divinity.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Then, that we should match<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> each heresy
with a particular opinion so as to show how the protagonist
of the heresy, meeting with these schemes, gained advantage
by seizing their principles and being driven on from
them to worse things constructed his own system.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Now the
undertaking is full of toil and requires much research.
But we shall not be found wanting. For at the last it will
give us much joy, as with the athlete who has won the
crown with much labour, or the merchant who has gained
profit after great tossing of the sea, or the husbandman who
gets the benefit of his crops from the sweat of his brow,
or the prophet who after reproaches and insults sees his
predictions come to pass.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> We will therefore begin by
declaring which of the Greeks first made demonstration
of natural philosophy. For of them especially have the
protagonists of the heretics become the plagiarists, as we
<span class="sidenote">p. 7.</span>
shall afterwards show by setting them side by side. And
when we have restored to each of these pioneers his own,
we shall put the heresiarchs beside them naked and
unseemly.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_1">1. <i>Thales.</i></h3>

<p>It is said that Thales the Milesian, one of the seven sages,
was the first to take in hand natural philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> He said
that the beginning and end of the universe was water;<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> for
that from its solidification and redissolution all things have
been constructed and that all are borne about by it. And
that from it also come earthquakes and the turnings about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of the stars and the motions of the winds.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And that all
things are formed and flow in accordance with the nature of
the first cause of generation; but that the Divinity is that
which has neither beginning nor end.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Thales, having
devoted himself to the system of the stars and to an
enquiry into them, became for the Greeks the first who was
responsible for this branch of learning. And he, gazing
upon the heavens and saying that he was apprehending
<span class="sidenote">p. 8.</span>
with care the things above, fell into a well; whereupon a
certain servant maid of the name of Thratta<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> laughed at him
and said: “While intent on beholding things in heaven, he
does not see what is at his feet.” And he lived about the
time of Crœsus.</p>


<h3 id="I_2">2. <i>Pythagoras.</i></h3>

<p>And not far from this time there flourished another
philosophy founded by Pythagoras, who some say was a
Samian. They call it the Italic because Pythagoras, fleeing
from Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, took up his abode in
a city of Italy and there spent his life. Whose successors
in the school did not differ much from him in judgment.
And he, after having enquired into physics, combined with
it astronomy, geometry and music.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> And thus he showed
that unity is God,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and after curiously studying the nature of
number, he said that the cosmos makes melody and was
put together by harmony, and he first reduced the movement
of the seven stars<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> to rhythm and melody. Wondering,
however, at the arrangement of the universals,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
<span class="sidenote">p. 9.</span>
expected his disciples to keep silence as to the first things
learned by them, as if they were mystæ of the universe
coming into the cosmos. Thereafter when it seemed that
they had partaken sufficiently of the schooling of the discourses,
and could themselves philosophize about stars and
Nature, he, having judged them purified, bade them speak.
He divided the disciples into two classes, and called these
Esoterics and those Exoterics. To the first-named he entrusted
the more complete teaching, to the others the more
restricted. He applied himself<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> to magic<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> also, as they
say, and himself invented a philosophy of the origin of
Nature,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> based upon certain numbers and measures, saying
that the origin of the arithmetical philosophy comprised this
method by synthesis. The first number became a principle
which is one, illimitable, incomprehensible, and contains
within itself all the numbers that can come to infinity by
multiplication.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> But the first unit was by hypothesis the
origin of numbers, the which is a male monad begetting
like a father all the other numbers. In the second place is
the dyad, a female number, and the same is called even by
<span class="sidenote">p. 10.</span>
the arithmeticians. In the third place is the triad, a male
number, and it has been called odd by the arithmeticians’
decree. After all these is the tetrad, a female number,
and this is also called even, because it is female. Therefore
all the numbers derived from the genus<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (now the
illimitable genus is “number”) are four, from which was
constructed, according to them, the perfect number, the
decad. For the 1, 2, 3, 4 become 10 if for each number
its appropriate name be substantially kept.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This decad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
Pythagoras said was a sacred Tetractys, a source of everlasting
Nature containing roots within itself, and that from
the same number all the numbers have their beginning.
For the 11 and the 12 and the rest share the beginning of
their being from the 10. The four divisions of the same
decad, the perfect number, are called number, monad,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
square<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and cube. The conjunctions and minglings of
<span class="sidenote">p. 11.</span>
which make for the birth of increase and complete naturally
the fruitful number. For when the square is multiplied<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
by itself, it becomes a square squared; when into the cube,
the square cubed; when the cube is multiplied by the cube,
it becomes a cube cubed. So that all the numbers from
which comes the birth of things which are, are seven; to
wit: number, monad, square, cube, square of square, cube
of square and cube of cube.</p>

<p>He declared also that the soul is immortal and that
there is a change from one body to another.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Wherefore
he said that he himself had been before Trojan times
Aethalides,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and that in the Trojan era he was Euphorbus,
and after that Hermotimus the Samian, after which Pyrrho
of Delos, and fifthly Pythagoras. But Diodorus the Eretrian
and Aristoxenus the writer on music<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> say that Pythagoras<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
went to visit Zaratas<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> the Chaldæan; and Zaratas explained
to him that there are from the beginning two causes of
things that are, a father and mother: and that the father is
light and the mother, darkness: and the divisions of the
light are hot, dry, light (in weight) and swift; but those of
the darkness cold, moist, heavy and slow. From these the
<span class="sidenote">p. 12.</span>
whole cosmos was constructed, to wit: from a female and
a male; and that the nature of the cosmos<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> is according to
musical harmony, wherefore the sun makes his journey
rhythmically. And about the things which come into being
from the earth and cosmos, they say Zaratas spoke thus:
there are two demons,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> a heavenly one and an earthly. Of
these the earthly one sent on high a thing born from the earth
which is water; but that the heavenly fire partook of the
air, hot and cold. Wherefore, he says, none of these things
destroys or pollutes the soul, for the same are the substance
of all. And it is said that Pythagoras ordered that beans
should not be eaten, because Zaratas said that at the beginning
and formation of all things when the earth was still
being constructed and put together, the bean was produced.
And he says that a proof of this is, that if one chews a bean
to pulp and puts it in the sun for some time (for this plays
a direct part in the matter), it will give out the smell of
human seed. And he says that another proof is even
clearer. If when the bean is in flower, we take the bean
<span class="sidenote">p. 13.</span>
and its blossom, put it into a jar, anoint this, bury it in earth,
and in a few days dig it up, we shall see it at first having the
form of a woman’s <i>pudenda</i> and afterwards on close examination
a child’s head growing with it.</p>

<p>Pythagoras perished at Crotona in Italy having been
burned along with his disciples. And he had this custom
that when any one came to him as a disciple, he had to sell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
his possessions and deposit the money under seal with
Pythagoras, and remain silent sometimes for three and sometimes
for five years while he was learning. But on being
again set free, he mixed with the others and remained a
disciple and took his meals along with them. But if he
did not, he took back what belonged to him and was cast
out. Now the Esoterics were called Pythagoreans and the
others Pythagorists. And of his disciples who escaped the
burning were Lysis and Archippus and Zamolxis, Pythagoras’
house-slave, who is said to have taught the Druids
among the Celts to cultivate the Pythagorean philosophy.
And they say that Pythagoras learned numbers and measures
from the Egyptians, and being struck with the plausible,
imposing and with difficulty disclosed wisdom of the priests,
<span class="sidenote">p. 14.</span>
he imitated them also in enjoining silence and, lodging his
disciples in cells, made them lead a solitary life.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_3">3. <i>About Empedocles.</i></h3>

<p>But Empedocles, born after these men, also said many
things about the nature of demons, and how they being
very many go about managing things upon the earth. He
said that the beginning of the universe was Strife and
Friendship and that the intellectual fire of the monad is
God, and that all things were constructed from fire and
will be resolved into fire.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In which opinion the Stoics
also nearly agree, since they expect an ecpyrosis. But
most of all he accepted the change into different bodies,
saying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“For truly a boy I became, and a maiden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And bush, and bird of prey, and fish,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A wanderer from the salt sea.”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>


<p class="noin"><span class="sidenote">p. 15.</span>He declared that all souls transmigrated into all living
things.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> For Pythagoras the teacher of these men said he
himself had been Euphorbus who fought at Ilion, and
claimed to recognize the shield.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> This of Empedocles.</p>


<h3 id="I_4">4. <i>About Heraclitus.</i></h3>

<p>But Heraclitus of Ephesus, a physicist, bewailed all
things, accusing the ignorance of all life and of all men,
and pitying the life of mortals. For he claimed that
he knew all things and other men nothing.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> And he also
made statements nearly in accord with Empedocles, as he
said that Discord and Friendship were the beginning of all
things, and that the intellectual fire was God and that all
things were borne in upon one another and did not stand
still. And like Empedocles he said that every place of
ours was filled with evil things, and that these come as far
as the moon extending from the place surrounding the
earth, but go no further, since the whole place above the
moon is very pure.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Thus, too, it seemed to Heraclitus.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 16.</span>And after these came other physicists whose opinions we
do not think it needful to declare as they are in no way
incongruous with those aforesaid. But since the school
was by no means small, and many physicists afterwards
sprang from these, all discoursing in different fashion on the
nature of the universe, it seems also fit to us, now that we
have set forth the philosophy derived from Pythagoras, to
return in order of succession to the opinions of those who
adhered to Thales, and after recounting the same to come
to the ethical and logical philosophies, whereof Socrates
founded the ethical and Aristotle the dialectic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>


<h3 id="I_5">5. <i>About Anaximander.</i></h3>

<p>Now Anaximander was a hearer of Thales. He was
Anaximander of Miletus, son of Praxiades.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He said that
the beginning of the things that are was a certain nature of
the Boundless from which came into being the heavens and
the ordered worlds<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> within them. And that this principle
is eternal and grows not old and encompasses all the
ordered worlds. And he says time is limited by birth,

<span class="sidenote">p. 17.</span>

substance,<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and death. He said that the Boundless is a
principle and element of the things that are and was the
first to call it by the name of principle. But that there is
an eternal movement towards Him wherein it happens that
the heavens are born. And that the earth is a heavenly
body<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> supported by nothing, but remaining in its place by
reason of its equal distance from everything. And that its
form is a watery cylinder<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> like a stone pillar; and that we
tread on one of its surfaces, but that there is another
opposite to it. And that the stars are a circle of fire distinct
from the fire in the cosmos, but surrounded by air. And
that certain fiery exhalations exist in those places where the
stars appear, and by the obstruction of these exhalations
come the eclipses. And that the moon appears sometimes
waxing and sometimes waning through the obstruction or
closing of her paths. And that the circle of the sun is 27
times greater than that of the moon and that the sun is in
the highest place in the heavens and the circles of the fixed

<span class="sidenote">p. 18.</span>

stars in the lowest. And that the animals came into being
in moisture evaporated by the sun. And that mankind was
at the beginning very like another animal, to wit, a fish.
And that winds come from the separation and condensation
of the subtler atoms of the air<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and rain from the earth
giving back under the sun’s heat what it gets from the clouds,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[60]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
and lightnings from the severance of the clouds by the winds
falling upon them. He was born in the 3rd year of the
42nd Olympiad.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_6">6. <i>About Anaximenes.</i></h3>

<p>Anaximenes, who was also a Milesian, the son of Eurystratus,
said that the beginning was a boundless air from
which what was, is, and shall be and gods and divine things
came into being, while the rest came from their descendants.
But that the condition of the air is such that when
it is all over alike<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> it is invisible to the eye, but it is made
perceptible by cold and heat, by damp and by motion.
And that it is ever-moving, for whatever is changeable<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
changes not unless it be moved. For it appears different
when condensed and rarefied. For when it diffuses into
greater rarity fire is produced; but when again halfway

<span class="sidenote">p. 19.</span>

condensed into air, a cloud is formed from the air’s
compression; and when still further condensed, water, and
when condensed to the full, earth; and when to the very
highest degree, stones. And that consequently the great
rulers of formation are contraries, to wit, heat and cold.
And that the earth is a flat surface borne up on the air in
the same way as the sun and moon and the other stars.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
For all fiery things are carried through the air laterally.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
And that the stars are produced from the earth by reason of
the mist which rises from it and which when rarefied
becomes fire, and from this ascending fire<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the stars are
constructed. And that there are earth-like natures in the
stars’ place carried about with them. But he says that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
stars do not move under the earth, as others assume, but
round the earth<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> as a cap is turned on one’s head, and that
the sun is hidden, not because it is under the earth, but
because it is hidden by the earth’s higher parts, and by
reason of its greater distance from us. And because of
their great distance, the stars give out no heat. And that

<span class="sidenote">p. 20.</span>

winds are produced when the air after condensation
escapes rarefied; but that when it collects and is thus
condensed<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> to the full, it becomes clouds and thus changes
into water. Also that hail is produced when the water
brought down from the clouds is frozen; and snow when
the same clouds are wetter when freezing. And lightning
come when the clouds are forced apart by the strength of
the winds; for when thus driven apart, there is a brilliant and
fiery flash. Also that a rainbow is produced by the solar
rays falling upon solidified air, and an earthquake from the
earth’s increasing in size by heating and cooling. This
then Anaximenes. He flourished about the 1st year of the
58th Olympiad.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_7">7. <i>About Anaxagoras.</i></h3>

<p>After him was Anaxagoras of Clazomene, son of Hegesibulus.
He said that the beginning of the universe was mind
and matter, mind being the creator and matter that which
came unto being.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> For that when all things were together,
mind came and arranged them. He says, however, that the
material principles are boundless, even the smallest of
them. And that all things partake of movement, being

<span class="sidenote">p. 21.</span>

moved by mind, and that like things come together. And
that the things in heaven were set in order by their circular
motion.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> That therefore what was dense and moist and dark
and cold and everything heavy came together in the middle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
and from the compacting of this the earth was established;<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
but that the opposites, to wit, the hot, the brilliant and the
light were drawn off to the distant æther. Also that the earth
is fat in shape and remains suspended<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> through its great
size, and from there being no void and because the air
which is strongest bears (up) the upheld earth. And that the
sea exists from the moisture on the earth and the waters in
it evaporating and then condensing in a hollow place;<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and
that the sea is supposed to have come into being by this
and from the rivers flowing into it. And the rivers, too, are
established by the rains and the waters within the earth; for
the earth is hollow and holds water in its cavities. But
that the Nile increases in summer when the snows from the
northern parts are carried down into it. And that the sun
and moon and all the stars are burning stones and are

<span class="sidenote">p. 22.</span>

carried about by the rotation of the æther. And that below
the stars are the sun and moon and certain bodies not seen
by us whirled round together. And that the heat of the
stars is not felt by us because of their great distance from
the earth; but yet their heat is not like that of the sun from
their occupying a colder region. Also that the moon is
below the sun and nearer to us; and that the size of the sun
is greater than that of the Peloponnesus. And that the moon
has no light of her own, but only one from the sun. And
that the revolution of the stars takes place under the earth.
Also that the moon is eclipsed when the earth stands in her
way, and sometimes the stars which are below the moon,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
and the sun when the moon stands in his way during new
moons. And that both the sun and moon make turnings
(solstices) when driven back by the air; but that the moon
turns often through not being able to master the cold. He
was the first to determine the facts about eclipses and
renewals of light.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> And he said that the moon was like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
earth and had within it plains and ravines. And that the
Milky Way was the reflection of the light of the stars which
are not lighted up by the sun. And that the shooting stars

<span class="sidenote">p. 23.</span>

are as it were sparks which glance off from the movement
of the pole. And that winds are produced by the rarefaction
of the air by the sun and by their drying up as they get
towards the pole and are borne away from it. And that
thunderstorms are produced by heat falling upon the clouds.
And that earthquakes come from the upper air falling
upon that under the earth; for when this last is moved,
the earth upheld by it is shaken. And that animals at the
beginning were produced from water, but thereafter from
one another, and that males are born when the seed secreted
from the right parts of the body adheres to the right parts of
the womb and females when the opposite occurs. He
flourished in the 1st year of the 88th Olympiad, about which
time they say Plato was born.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> They say also that Anaxagoras
came to have a knowledge of the future.</p>


<h3 id="I_8">8. <i>About Archelaus.</i></h3>

<p>Archelaus was of Athenian race and the son of Apollodorus.
He like Anaxagoras asserted the mixed nature
of matter and agreed with him as to the beginning of
things. But he said that a certain mixture<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> was directly
inherent in mind, and that the source of movement is the
separation from one another of heat and cold and that the

<span class="sidenote">p. 24.</span>

heat is moved and the cold remains undisturbed. Also
that water when heated flows to the middle of the universe
wherein heated air and earth are produced, of which one is
borne aloft while the other remains below. And that the
earth remains fixed and exists because of this and abides in
the middle of the universe, of which, so to speak, it forms
no part and which is delivered from the conflagration.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The
first result of which burning is the nature of the stars, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
greatest whereof is the sun and the second the moon while
of the others some are greater and some smaller. And he
says that the heaven is arched over us<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and has made the
air transparent and the earth dry. For that at first it was a
pool; since it was lofty at the horizon, but hollow in the
middle. And he brings forward as a proof of this hollowness,
that the sun does not rise and set at the same time for all
parts as must happen if the earth were level. And as to
animals, he says that the earth first became heated in the
lower part when the hot and cold mingled and man<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and
the other animals appeared. And all things were unlike

<span class="sidenote">p. 25.</span>

one another and had the same diet, being nourished on
mud. And this endured for a little, but at last generation
from one another arose, and man became distinct from the
other animals and set up chiefs, laws, arts, cities and the rest.
And he says that mind is inborn in all animals alike. For
that every body is supplied with<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> mind, some more slowly
and some quicker than the others.</p>

<p>Natural philosophy lasted then from Thales up to Archelaus.
Of this last Socrates was a hearer. But there are also
many others putting forward different tenets concerning the
Divine and the nature of the universe, whose opinions if we
wished to set them all out would take a great mass of books.
But it would be best, after having recalled by name those
of them who are, so to speak, the chorus-leaders of all
who philosophized in later times and who have furnished
starting-points for systems, to hasten on to what follows.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_9">9. <i>About Parmenides.</i></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 26.</span>For truly Parmenides also supposed the universe to
be eternal and ungenerated and spherical in form.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Nor did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
he avoid the common opinion making fire and earth the
principles of the universe, the earth as matter, but the fire
as cause and creator. [He said that the ordered world
would be destroyed, but in what way, he did not say.]<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
But he said that the universe was eternal and ungenerated
and spherical in form and all over alike, bearing no impress
and immoveable and with definite limits.</p>


<h3 id="I_10">10. <i>About Leucippus.</i></h3>

<p>But Leucippus, a companion of Zeno, did not keep to the
same opinion (as Parmenides), but says that all things are
boundless and ever-moving and that birth and change are
unceasing. And he says that fulness and the void are
elements. And he says also that the ordered worlds came
into being thus: when many bodies were crowded together

<span class="sidenote">p. 27.</span>

and flowed from the ambient<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> into a great void, on
coming into contact with one another, those of like fashion
and similar form coalesced, and from their intertwining yet
others were generated and increased and diminished by
a certain necessity. But what that necessity may be he did
not define.</p>


<h3 id="I_11">11. <i>About Democritus.</i></h3>

<p>But Democritus was an acquaintance of Leucippus.
This was Democritus of Abdera, son of Damasippus,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> who
met with many Gymnosophists among the Indians and with
priests and astrologers<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> in Egypt and with Magi in Babylon.
But he speaks like Leucippus about elements, to wit, fulness
and void, saying that the full is that which is but the
void that which is not, and he said this because things are
ever moving in the void. He said also that the ordered
worlds are boundless and differ in size, and that in some
there is neither sun nor moon, but that in others both are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
greater than with us, and in yet others more in number.

<span class="sidenote">p. 28.</span>

And that the intervals between the ordered worlds are
unequal, here more and there less, and that some increase,
others flourish and others decay, and here they come into
being and there they are eclipsed.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> But that they are
destroyed by colliding with one another. And that some
ordered worlds are bare of animals and plants and of all water.
And that in our cosmos the earth came into being first of the
stars and that the moon is the lowest of the stars, and then
comes the sun and then the fixed stars: but that the planets
are not all at the same height. And he laughed at everything,
as if all things among men deserved laughter.</p>


<h3 id="I_12">12. <i>About Xenophanes.</i></h3>

<p>But Xenophanes of Colophon was the son of Orthomenes.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
He survived until the time of Cyrus. He first
declared the incomprehensibility of all things,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> saying thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Although anyone should speak most definitely</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He nevertheless does not know, and it is a guess<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> which occurs about all things.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 29.</span>But he says that nothing is generated, or perishes or is
moved, and that the universe which is one is beyond change.
But he says that God is eternal, and one and alike on every
side, and finite and spherical in form, and conscious<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> in all
His parts. And that the sun is born every day from the
gathering together of small particles of fire and that the earth
is boundless and surrounded neither by air nor by heaven.
And that there are boundless (innumerable) suns and
moons and that all things are from the earth. He said that
the sea is salt because of the many compounds which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
together flow into it. But Metrodorus said it was thanks to
its trickling through the earth that the sea becomes salt.
And Xenophanes opines that there was once a mixture
of earth with the sea, and that in time it was freed from
moisture, asserting in proof of this that shells are found in the
centre of the land and on mountains, and that in the stone-quarries
of Syracuse were found the impress of a fish and of
seals, and in Paros the cast of an anchor below the surface
of the rock<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and in Malta layers of all sea-things. And he
says that these came when all things were of old time buried
in mud, and that the impress of them dried in the mud; but

<span class="sidenote">p. 30.</span>

that all men were destroyed when the earth being cast into
the sea became mud, and that it again began to bring forth
and that this catastrophe happened to all the ordered worlds.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_13">13. <i>About Ecphantus.</i></h3>

<p>A certain Ecphantus, a Syracusan, said that a true
knowledge of the things that are could not be got. But he
defines, as he thinks, that the first bodies are indivisible and
that there are three differences<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> between them, to wit, size,
shape and power. And the number of them is limited and
not boundless; but that these bodies are moved neither by
weight nor by impact, but by a divine power which he calls

<span class="sidenote">p. 31.</span>

Nous and Psyche. Now the pattern of this is the cosmos,
wherefore it has become spherical in form by Divine power.
And that the earth in the midst of the cosmos is moved
round its own centre from west to east.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_14">14. <i>About Hippo.</i></h3>

<p>But Hippo of Rhegium<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> said that the principles were
cold, like water, and heat, like fire. And that the fire came
from the water, and, overcoming the power of its parent,
constructed the cosmos. But he said that the soul was
sometimes brain and sometimes water; for the seed also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
seems to us to be from moisture and from it he says the
soul is born.</p>

<p>These things, then, we seem to have sufficiently set forth.
Wherefore, as we have now separately run through the
opinions of the physicists, it seems fitting that we return to
Socrates and Plato, who most especially preferred (the
study of) ethics.</p>


<h3 id="I_15">15. <i>About Socrates.</i></h3>

<p>Now Socrates became a hearer of Archelaus the physicist,
and giving great honour to the maxim “Know thyself”
and having established a large school, held Plato to be the
most competent of all his disciples. He left no writings

<span class="sidenote">p. 32.</span>

behind him; but Plato being impressed with all his
wisdom<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> established the teaching combining physics, ethics
and dialectics. But what Plato laid down is this:&mdash;</p>


<h3 id="I_16">16. <i>About Plato.</i></h3>

<p>Plato makes the principles of the universe to be God,
matter and (the) model. He says that God is the maker and
orderer of this universe and its Providence.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> That matter
is that which underlies all things, which matter he calls a
recipient and a nurse.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> From which, after it had been set
in order, came the four elements of which the cosmos is
constructed, to wit, fire, air, earth and water,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> whence in
turn all the other so-called compound things, viz., animals
and plants have been constructed. But the model is the
thought of God which Plato also calls <i>ideas</i>, to which
giving heed as to an image in the soul,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> God fashioned<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>

<span class="sidenote">p. 33.</span>

things. He said that God was without body or form and
could only be comprehended by wise men; but that matter
is potentially body, but not yet actively. For that being
itself without form or quality, it receives forms and qualities
to become body.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> That matter, therefore, is a principle
and the same is coeval with God, and the cosmos is unbegotten.
For, he says, it constructed itself out of itself.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
And in all ways it is like the unbegotten and is imperishable.
But in so far as body<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> is assumed to be composed of many
qualities and ideas, it is so far begotten and perishable.
But some Platonists mixed together the two opinions
making up some such parable as this: to wit, that, as a
wagon can remain undestroyed for ever if repaired part by
part, as even though the parts perish every time, the wagon
remains complete; so, the cosmos, although it perish part
by part, is yet reconstructed and compensated for the parts
taken away, and remains eternal.</p>

<p>Some again say that Plato declared God to be one,
unbegotten and imperishable, as he says in the <i>Laws</i>:&mdash;“God,

<span class="sidenote">p. 34.</span>

therefore, as the old story goes, holds the beginning
and end and middle of all things that are.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Thus he
shows Him to be one through His containing all things.
But others say that Plato thought that there are many gods
without limitation<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> when he said, “God of gods, of whom
I am the fashioner and father.”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> And yet others that he
thinks them subject to limitation when he says: “Great
Zeus, indeed, driving his winged chariot in heaven;”<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and
when he gives the pedigree<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> of the children of Uranos and
Gê. Others again that he maintained the gods to be
originated and that because they were originated they ought
to perish utterly, but that by the will of God they remain
imperishable as he says in the passage before quoted, “God
of gods, of whom I am the fashioner and father, and who
are formed by my will indissoluble.” So that if He wished
them to be dissolved, dissolved they would easily be. But
he accepts the nature of demons, and says some are good,
and some bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>And some say that he declared the soul to be unoriginated
and imperishable<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> when he says: “All soul is
immortal for that which is ever moving is immortal,” and
when he shows that it is self-moving and the beginning of
movement. But others say that he makes it originated but
imperishable<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> through God’s will; and yet others composite
and originated and perishable. For he also supposes that

<span class="sidenote">p. 35.</span>

there is a mixing-bowl for it,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and that it has a splendid
body, but that everything originated must of necessity
perish. But those who say that the soul is immortal are
partly corroborated by those words wherein he says that
there are judgments after death, and courts of justice in the
house of Hades, and that the good meet with a good reward
and that the wicked are subjected to punishments.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Some
therefore say that he also admits a change of bodies and
the transfer of different pre-determined souls into other
bodies according to the merit of each; and that after certain
definite peregrinations they are again sent into this ordered
world to give themselves another trial of their own choice.
Others, however, say not, but that they obtain a place
according to each one’s deserts. And they call to witness
that he says some souls are with Zeus, but that others of
good men are going round with other gods, and that others
abide in everlasting punishments, (that is), so many as in this
life have wrought evil and unjust deeds.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
And they say that he declared some conditions to be

<span class="sidenote">p. 36.</span>

without intermediates, some with intermediates and some
to be intermediates. Waking and sleep are without intermediates
and so are all states like these. But there are
those with intermediates like good and bad; and intermediates
like grey which is between black and white or
some other colour.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> And they say that he declares the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
things concerning the soul to be alone supremely good, but
those of the body or external to it to be no longer
supremely good, but only said to be so. And that these
last are very often named intermediates also; for they can
be used both well and ill. He says therefore that the
virtues are extremes as to honour, but means as to substance.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
For there is nothing more honourable than
virtue; but that which goes beyond or falls short of these
virtues ends in vice. For instance, he says that these are
the four virtues, to wit, Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and
Fortitude, and that there follow on each of these two vices
of excess and deficiency respectively. Thus on Prudence
follow thoughtlessness by deficiency and cunning by
excess; on Temperance, intemperance by deficiency and
sluggishness by excess; on Justice, over-modesty by
deficiency and greediness by excess; and on Fortitude,

<span class="sidenote">p. 37.</span>

cowardice by deficiency and foolhardiness by excess.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
And these virtues when inborn in a man operate for his
perfection and give him happiness. But he says that
happiness is likeness to God as far as possible. And that
any one is like God when he becomes holy and just with
intention. For this he supposes to be the aim of the
highest wisdom and virtue.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> But he says that the virtues
follow one another in turn and are of one kind, and never
oppose one another; but that the vices are many-shaped
and sometimes follow and sometimes oppose one another.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>He says, again, that there is destiny, not indeed that all
things are according to destiny, but that we have some
choice, as he says in these words: “The blame is on the
chooser: God is blameless,” and again, “This is a law of
Adrasteia.” And if he thus affirms the part of destiny, he
knew also that something was in our choice.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> But he says
that transgressions are involuntary. For to the most beautiful
thing in us, which is the soul, none would admit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
something evil, that is, injustice; but that by ignorance and
mistaking the good, thinking to do something fine, they

<span class="sidenote">p. 38.</span>

arrive at the evil.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> And his explanation on this is most
clear in the <i>Republic</i>, where he says: “And again do you
dare to say that vice is disgraceful and hateful to God?
How then does any one choose such an evil? He does it,
you would say, who is overcome by the pleasures (of sense).
Therefore this also is an involuntary action, if to overcome
be a voluntary one. So that from all reasoning, reason proves
injustice to be involuntary.” But some one objects to him
about this: “Why then are men punished if they transgress
involuntarily?” He answers: “So that they may be the
more speedily freed from vice by undergoing correction.”<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
For that to undergo correction is not bad but good, if thereby
comes purification from vices, and that the rest of mankind
hearing of it will not transgress, but will be on their guard
against such error.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> He says, however, that the nature of
evil comes not by God nor has it any special nature of its
own; but it comes into being by contrariety and by
following upon the good, either as excess or deficiency as
we have before said about the virtues.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> Now Plato, as

<span class="sidenote">p. 39.</span>

we have said above, bringing together the three divisions
of general philosophy, thus philosophized.</p>


<h3 id="I_17">17. <i>About Aristotle.</i></h3>

<p>Aristotle, who was a hearer of this last, turned philosophy
into a science and reasoned more strictly, affirming that
the elements of all things are substance and accident.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> He
said that there is one substance underlying all things, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
nine accidents, which are Quantity, Quality, Relation, the
Where, the When, Possession, Position, Action and Passion.
And that therefore Substance was such as God, man and
every one of the things which can fall under the like definition:
but that as regards the accidents, Quality is seen
in expressions like white or black; Quantity in “2 cubits or
3 cubits long or broad”; Relation in “father” or “son”; the
Where in such as “Athens” or “Megara”; the When in
such as “in the Xth Olympiad”; for Possession in such
as “to have acquired wealth”; Action in such as “to write
and generally to do anything”; and Passion in such as “to
be struck.” He also assumes that some things have means
and that others have not, as we have said also about Plato.

<span class="sidenote">p. 40.</span>

And he is in accord with Plato about most things save in
the opinion about the soul. For Plato thinks it immortal;
but Aristotle that it remains behind after this life and that
it is lost in the fifth Body which is assumed to exist along
with the other four, to wit, fire, earth, water and air, but
is more subtle than they and like a spirit.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Again whereas
Plato said that the only good things were those which
concerned the soul and that these sufficed for happiness,
Aristotle brings in a triad of benefits and says that the sage
is not perfect unless there are at his command the good
things of the body and those external to it. Which
things are Beauty, Strength, Keenness of Sense and Completeness;
while the externals are Wealth, High Birth,
Glory, Power, Peace, and Friendship; but that the inner
things about the soul are, as Plato thought: Prudence,
Temperance, Justice and Fortitude.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Also Aristotle says
that evil things exist, and come by contrariety to the good,
and are below the place about the moon, but not above it.</p>

<p>Again, he says that the soul of the whole ordered world is
eternal, but that the soul of man vanishes as we have said

<span class="sidenote">p. 41.</span>

above. Now, he philosophized while delivering discourses
in the Lyceum; but Zeno in the Painted Porch. And
Zeno’s followers got their name from the place, <i>i. e.</i> they
were called Stoics from the Stoa; but those of Aristotle
from their mode of study. For their enquiries were conducted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
while walking about in the Lyceum, wherefore they
were called Peripatetics. This then Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_18">18. <i>About the Stoics.</i></h3>

<p>The Stoics themselves also added to philosophy by the
increased use of syllogisms,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and included it nearly all in
definitions, Chrysippus and Zeno being here agreed in
opinion. Who also supposed that God was the beginning
of all things, and was the purest body, and that His
providence extends through all things.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> They say positively,
however, that existence is everywhere according to
destiny using some such simile as this: viz. that, as a dog tied
to a cart, if he wishes to follow it, is both drawn along by
it and follows of his own accord, doing at the same time

<span class="sidenote">p. 42.</span>

what he wills and what he must by a compulsion like that
of destiny.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> But if he does not wish to follow he is wholly
compelled. And they say that it is the same indeed with
men. For even if they do not wish to follow, they will be
wholly compelled to come to what has been foredoomed.
And they say that the soul remains after death, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
it is a body<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> and is born from the cooling of the air of
the ambient, whence it is called Psyche.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But they admit
that there is a change of bodies for Souls which have been
marked out for it.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> And they expect that there will be
a conflagration and purification of this cosmos, some saying
that it will be total but others partial, and that it will be
purified part by part. And they call this approximate
destruction and the birth of another cosmos therefrom,
<i>catharsis</i>.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> And they suppose that all things are bodies,
and that one body passes through another; but that there
is a resurrection<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and that all things are filled full and that
there is no void. Thus also the Stoics.</p>


<h3 id="I_19">19. <i>About Epicurus.</i></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 43.</span>But Epicurus held an opinion almost the opposite of all
others. He supposed that the beginnings of the universals
were atoms and a void; that the void was as it were the
place of the things that will be; but that the atoms were
matter, from which all things are. And that from the
concourse of the atoms both God and all the elements
came into being and that in them were all animals and
other things, so that nothing is produced or constructed
unless it be from the atoms. And he said that the atoms
were the most subtle of things, and that in them there
could be no point, nor mark nor any division whatever;
wherefore he called them atoms.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> And although he admits
God to be eternal and imperishable, he says that he cares
for no one and that in short there is no providence nor
destiny, but all things come into being automatically. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
God is seated in the metacosmic spaces, as he calls them.
For he held that there was a certain dwelling-place of God
outside the cosmos called the metacosmia, and that He

<span class="sidenote">p. 44</span>

took His pleasure and rested in supreme delight; and that
He neither had anything to do Himself nor provided for
others. In consequence of which Epicurus made a theory
about wise men, saying that the end of all wisdom is
pleasure. But different people take the name of pleasure
differently. For some understood by it the desires, but
others the pleasure that comes by virtue. But he held
that the souls of men were destroyed with their bodies
as they are born with them. For that these souls are
blood, which having come forth or being changed, the
whole man is destroyed. Whence it follows that there
are no judgments nor courts of justice in the House of
Hades, so that whatever any one may do in this life and
escapes notice, he is in no way called to account for it.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Thus then Epicurus.</p>


<h3 id="I_20">20. <i>About (the) Academics.</i></h3>

<p>But another sect of philosophers was called Academic,

<span class="sidenote">p. 45.</span>

from their holding their discussions in the Academy, whose
founder was Pyrrho, after whom they were called Pyrrhonian
philosophers. He first introduced the dogma of the
incomprehensibility of all things, so that he might argue
on either side of the question, but assert nothing dogmatically.
For he said that there is nothing grasped by the
mind or perceived by the senses which is true, but that
it only appears to men to be so. And that all substance
is flowing and changing and never remains in the same
state. Now some of the Academics say that we ought not
to make dogmatic assertions about the principle of anything,
but simply argue about it and let it be; while others
favoured more the “no preference”<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> adage, saying that
fire was not fire rather than anything else. For they did
not assert what it is, but only what sort of a thing it is.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>


<h3 id="I_21">21. <i>About (the) Brachmans among the Indians.</i></h3>

<p>The Indians have also a sect of philosophizers in the
Brachmans<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> who propose to themselves an independent life
and abstain from all things which have had life and from

<span class="sidenote">p. 46.</span>

meats prepared by fire. They are content with fruits<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> but
do not gather even these, but live on those fallen on the
earth and drink the water of the river Tagabena.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But
they spend their lives naked, saying that the body has
been made by God as a garment to the soul. They say
that God is light; not such light as one sees, nor like the
sun and fire, but that it is to them the Divine Word, not
that which is articulated, but that which comes from knowledge,
whereby the hidden mysteries of nature are seen
by the wise. But this light which they say is (the) Word,
the God, they declare that they themselves as Brachmans
alone know, because they alone put away vain thinking
which is the last tunic of the soul. They scorn death; but
are ever naming God in their own tongue, as we have said
above, and send up hymns to Him. But neither are there
women among them, nor do they beget children.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Those,
however, who have desired a life like theirs, after they

<span class="sidenote">p. 47.</span>

have crossed over to the opposite bank of the river,<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> remain
there always and never return; but they also are called
Brachmans. Yet they do not pass their life in the same
way; for there are women in the country, from whom those
dwelling there are begotten and beget. But they say that
this Word, which they style God, is corporeal, girt with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
body outside Himself, as if one should wear a garment of
sheepskins; but that the body which is worn, when taken
off, appears visible to the eye.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> But the Brachmans declare
that there is war in the body worn by them [and they
consider their body full of warring elements] against which
body as if arrayed against foes, they fight as we have before
made plain. And they say that all men are captives to
their own congenital enemies, to wit, the belly and genitals,
greediness, wrath, joy, grief, desire and the like. But
that he alone goes to God who has triumphed<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> over
these. Wherefore the Brachmans make Dandamis, to
whom Alexander of Macedon paid a visit, divine<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> as
one who had won the war in the body. But they accuse
Calanus of having impiously fallen away from their philosophy.
But the Brachmans putting away the body, like

<span class="sidenote">p. 48.</span>

fish who have leaped from the water into pure air, behold
the Sun.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>


<h3 id="I_22">22. <i>About the Druids among the Celts.</i></h3>

<p>The Druids among the Celts enquired with the greatest
minuteness into the Pythagorean philosophy, Zamolxis,
Pythagoras’ slave, a Thracian by race, being for them the
author of this discipline. He after Pythagoras’ death
travelled into their country and became as far as they
were concerned the founder of this philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
Celts glorify the Druids as prophets and as knowing the
future because they foretell to them some things by
the ciphers and numbers of the Pythagoric art. On the
principles of which same art we shall not be silent, since
some men have ventured to introduce heresies constructed
from them. Druids, however, also make use of magic arts.</p>

<h3 id="I_23" title="23. About Hesiod.">23. <i>About Hesiod.</i><a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></h3>

<p>But Hesiod the poet says that he, too, heard thus
from the Muses about Nature. The Muses, however, are
the daughters of Zeus. For Zeus having from excess of
desire companied with Mnemosyne for nine days and nights
consecutively, she conceived these nine in her single womb,
receiving one every night. Now Hesiod invokes the nine
Muses from Pieria, that is from Olympus, and prays them
to teach him:<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

set forth. Starting from which opinions the heretics
have made the attempts we shall shortly narrate. It seems
fitting, however, that we, first making public the mystic
rites,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> should also declare whatever things certain men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
have superfluously fancied about stars or magnitudes; for
truly those who have taken their starting-points from these
notions are deemed by the many to speak prodigies.
Thereafter, we shall make plain consecutively the vain
opinions<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> invented by them.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="label">[1]</a> As has been said in the Introduction (p. <a href="#Page_1">1</a> <i>supra</i>) four early
codices of the First Book exist, the texts being known from the
libraries where they are to be found as the Medicean, the Turin, the
Ottobonian and the Barberine respectively. That published by
Miller was a copy of the Medicean codex already put into print by
Fabricius, but was carefully worked over by Roeper, Scott and others
who like Gronovius, Wolf and Delarue, collated it with the other
three codices. The different readings are, I think, all noted by Cruice
in his edition of 1860, but are not of great importance, and I have only
noticed them here when they make any serious change in the meaning
of the passage. Hermann Diels has again revised the text in his
<i>Doxographi Græci</i>, Berlin, 1879, with a result that Salmon (<i>D.C.B.</i>
s. v. “Hippolytus Romanus”) declares to be “thoroughly satisfactory,”
and the reading of this part of our text may now, perhaps, be
regarded as settled. Only the opening and concluding paragraphs are
of much value for our present purpose, the account of philosophic
opinions which lies between being, as has been already said, a
compilation of compilations, and not distinguished by any special
insight into the ideas of the authors summarized, with the works of most
of whom Hippolytus had probably but slight acquaintance. An exception
should perhaps be made in the case of Aristotle, as it is probable that
Hippolytus, like other students of his time, was trained in Aristotle’s
dialectic and analytic system for the purpose of disputation. But this
will be better discussed in connection with Book VII.</p>

him the founder of the Sceptics. He was a contemporary of Alexander

puerilities to Pythagoras himself. Diog. Laert., Aristotle
and the rest represent him as saying only that the monad was the
beginning of everything, and that from this and the undefined dyad
numbers proceed. The general reader may be recommended to Mr.
Alfred Williams Benn’s statement in <i>The Philosophy of Greece</i> (Lond.,
1898), pp. 78 ff. that “the Greeks did not think of numbers as pure
abstractions, but in the most literal sense as figures, that is to say,
limited portions of space.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="label">[38]</a> Macmahon thinks “number” and “monad” should here be
transposed, as Pythagoras considered according to him the monad as
“the highest generalization of number and a conception in abstraction.”
Yet the monad was not the highest abstraction of current (Greek)
philosophy. See Edwin Hatch, <i>Influence of Greek Ideas upon the
Christian Church</i> (Hibbert Lectures), Lond., 1890, p. 255.</p>

themselves up in cells of the Serapeum, which they could hardly have
done in any temple in Pharaonic times. See <i>Forerunners</i>, I, 79.

them. In the <i>Categories</i>, which, whether by Aristotle or not, are not
referred to by him in any of his extant works, it is said (c. 4) that “of
things in complex enunciated, each signifies <i>either</i> Substance or
Quantity, or Quality or Relation, or Where or When, or Position, or

Archedemus and Posidonius as agreeing that principles and
elements differ from one another in being respectively indestructible
and destroyed, and because elements are bodies while principles have
none. For the Stoic idea of God, see <i>op. cit.</i>, c. 70. So Cicero, <i>De
Natura Deorum</i>, Bk. I, cc. 8, 18, makes Zeno say that the cosmos is
God, but in the <i>Academics</i>, II, 41 that Aether is the Supreme God,
with which doctrine, he says, nearly all Stoics agree. Perhaps Hippolytus
is here quoting Clement of Alexandria, <i>Stromateis</i>, VI, 71, who
says that the Stoics dare to make the God of all things “a corporeal
spirit.” For the Stoic doctrine of Providence, see Diog. Laert., <i>vit.

<p><a id="Footnote_253" href="#FNanchor_253" class="label">[161]</a> The main question which arises on this First Book of our text is,
What were the sources from which Hippolytus drew the opinions he
here summarizes? Diels, who has taken much pains over the matter,
thinks that his chief source was the epitome that Sotion of Alexandria
made from Heraclides. As we have seen, however, Diogenes Laertius
is responsible for a fair number of Hippolytus’ statements, especially
concerning the opinions of those to whom he gives little space. Certain
phrases seem taken directly from Theophrastus or from whatever
author it was that Simplicius used in his commentaries on Aristotle,
and the likeness between Alcinous’ summary of Plato’s doctrines and
those of our author is too close to be accidental. It therefore seems
most probable that Hippolytus did not confine himself to any one
source, but borrowed from several. This would, after all, be the
natural course for a lecturer as distinguished from a writer to adopt,
and goes some way therefore towards confirming the theory as to the
origin of the book stated in the Introduction.</p>

<p>Our only ground for conjecture as to the contents of
Books II and III is to be found in Hippolytus’ statement at
the end of Book I, that he will <i>first</i> make public the mystic
rites<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and then the fancies of certain philosophers as to
stars and magnitudes. As the promise in the last words of
the sentence seems to be fulfilled in Book IV, where he
gives not only the method of the astrologers of his time,
but also the calculations of the Greek astronomers as to
the relative distances of the heavenly bodies, it may be
presumed that this was preceded and not followed by a
description of the Mysteries more elaborate and fuller than
the casual allusions to them which appear in Book V. So,
too, in Chap. 5 of the same Book IV, which he himself
describes in the heading as a “Recapitulation” of what has
gone before, he refers to certain dogmas of the Persians and
the Babylonians as to the nature of God, which have certainly
not been mentioned in any other part of the book which
has come down to us. So, again, at the beginning of
Book X, which purports to be a summary of the whole
work, he tells us that having now gone through the
“labyrinth of heresies,” it will be shown that the Truth is
not derived from “the wisdom (philosophy) of the Greeks,
the secret mysteries of the Egyptians,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the fallacies of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
astrologers, or the demon-inspired ravings of the Babylonians.”
The Greek philosophy and astrological fallacies are
dealt with at sufficient length in Books I and IV respectively,
but nothing of importance is said in these or elsewhere in
the work as to the mysteries of the “Egyptians,” by whom
he probably means the worshippers of the Alexandrian
divinities, and nothing at all as to Babylonian demonolatry
or magic. It is quite true that he follows this up immediately
by the statement that he has included the tenets of all
the wise men among the <i>Greeks</i> in four books, and the
doctrines of the heretics in five; but it has been explained
in the Introduction (pp. <a href="#Page_18">18</a> ff. <i>supra</i>) that there are reasons
why the summarizer’s recollection of the earlier books may
not be verbally accurate, nor does he say that the description
of the philosophic and heretical teachings exhausted the
contents of the first four books. On the whole, therefore,
Cruice appears to be justified in his conclusion that the
missing books contained an account of the “Egyptian”
Mysteries and of “the sacred sciences of the Babylonians.”)<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_256" href="#FNanchor_256" class="label">[3]</a> M. Adhémar d’Alès in his work <i>La Théologie de St. Hippolyte</i>,
Paris, 1906, argues that the existing text of Book IV contains large
fragments of the missing Books II and III. His argument is chiefly
founded on the supposed excessive length of Book IV, although as a fact
Book V is in Cruice’s pagination some 20 pages longer than this and Book
VI, 10. Apart from this, it seems very doubtful if any author would
describe the arithmomantic and arithmetical nonsense in Book IV as
either μυστικά or δόγματα ἄρρητα, and it is certain that he cannot be
alluding, when he speaks of the Βαβυλωνίων ἀλογίστῳ μανίᾳ δι’ ἐν(εργί)ας
δαιμόνων καταπλαγείς, to the jugglery in the same book, which he there
attributes not to the agency of demons but to the tricks of charlatans.</p>

<p>1. The “Chaldæans” or Astrologers, and the celestial
measurements of the Greek astronomers.</p>

sealed letters, perform divinations, produce apparitions of
gods and demons, and work other wonders.</p>

<p>5. Recapitulation of the ideas of Greek and Barbarian
on the nature of God, and the views of the “Egyptians” or
neo-Pythagoreans as to the mysteries of number.</p>

<p>6. The star-diviners or those who find religious meaning

<p>... (And they (<i>i. e.</i> the Chaldæans) declare there are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
“terms”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the stars in each zodiacal sign extending
from one given part)<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to [another given part in which some
particular star has most power. About which there is no
mere chance difference] among them [as appears from their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
tables]. But they say that the stars are guarded<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> [when
they are midway between two other stars] in zodiacal
succession. For instance, if [a certain star should occupy
the first part] of a zodiacal sign and another [the last parts,
and a third those of the middle, the one in the middle is
said to be guarded] by those occupying the parts at the
extremities. [And they say that the stars behold one another
and are in accord with one another] when they appear
triangularly or quadrangularly. Now those form a triangular

<span class="sidenote">p. 54.</span>

figure<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and behold one another which have an interval of
three zodiacal signs between them and a square those which
have one of two signs....</p>

<p>(<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>Such then seems to be the character of the Chaldæan
method. And in that which has been handed down it
remains easy to understand and follow the contradictions
noted. And some indeed try to teach a rougher way as if
earthly things have no sympathy<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> at all with the heavenly
ones. For thus they say, that the ambient<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is not united
as is the human body, so that according to the condition)
of the head the lower parts [suffer with it and the head with
the lower] parts, and earthly things should suffer along with
those above the moon. But there is a certain difference and
want of sympathy between them as they have not one and
[the] same unity.</p>

<p>2. Making use of these statements, Euphrates the Peratic
and Akembes the Carystian<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the rest of the band of
these people, miscalling the word of Truth, declare that
there is a war of æons and a falling-away of good powers to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
the bad, calling them Toparchs and Proastii<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and many
other names. All which heresy undertaken by them, I
shall set forth and refute when we come to the discussion
concerning them. But now, lest any one should deem trustworthy
and unfailing the rules laid down<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> by the Chaldæans

<span class="sidenote">p. 55.</span>

for the astrological art, we shall not shrink from briefly
setting forth their refutation and pointing out that their art
is vain and rather deceives and destroys the soul which may
hope for vain things than helps it. In which matters we do
not hold out any expertness in the art, but only that drawn
from knowledge of the practical words.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Those who, having
been trained in this science, become pupils of the Chaldæans
and who having changed the names only, have imparted
mysteries as if they were strange and wonderful to men, have
constructed a heresy out of this. But since they consider the
astrologers’ art a mighty one and making use of the witness
of the Chaldæans wish to get their own systems believed
because of them, we shall now prove that the astrological
art as it appears to-day is unfounded, and then that the
Peratic heresy is to be put aside as a branch growing from a
root which does not hold.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>3.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Now the beginning and as it were the basis of the
affair is the establishment of the horoscope. From this the
rest of the cardinal points, and the cadents and succeedents
and the trines and the squares<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and the configuration of the
stars in them are known, from all which things the predictions

<span class="sidenote">p. 56.</span>

are made. Wherefore if the horoscope be taken
away, of necessity neither the midheaven nor the descendant
nor the anti-meridian is known. But the whole Chaldaic
system vanishes if these are not disclosed. [And how the
zodiacal sign ascending is to be discovered is taught in
divers ways. For in order that this may be apprehended,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
it is necessary first of all that the birth of the child falling
under consideration be carefully taken, and secondly that
the signalling of the time<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> be unerring, and thirdly that the
rising in the heaven of the ascending sign be observed with
the greatest care. For at the birth<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the rising of the sign
ascending in the heaven must be closely watched, since the
Chaldæans determining that which ascends, on its rising
make that disposition of the stars which they call the
Theme,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> from which they declare their predictions. But
neither is it possible to take the birth of those falling under
consideration, as I shall show, nor is the time established

<span class="sidenote">p. 57.</span>

unerringly, nor is the ascending sign ascertained with care.
How baseless the system of the Chaldæans is, we will now
say. It is necessary before determining the birth of those
falling under consideration, to inquire whether they take it
from the deposition of the seed and its conception or from
the bringing forth. And if we should attempt to take it
from the conception, the accurate account of this is hard to
grasp, the time being short and naturally so. For we cannot
say whether conception takes place simultaneously with the
transfer of the seed or not. For this may happen as quick as
thought, as the tallow put into heated pots sticks fast at once,
or it may take place after some time.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> For there being a
distance from the mouth of the womb to the other extremity,
where conceptions are said by doctors to take place, it is
natural that nature depositing the seed should take some time
to accomplish this distance. Therefore the Chaldæans being
ignorant of the exact length of time will never discover
exactly the time of conception, the seed being sometimes

<span class="sidenote">p. 58.</span>

shot straight forward and falling in those places of the
womb fitted by nature for conception, and sometimes falling
broadcast to be only brought into place by the power of the
womb itself. And it cannot be known when the first of
these things happens and when the second, nor how much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
time is spent in one sort of conception and how much in
the other. But if we are ignorant of these things, the
accurate discovery of the nature of the conception vanishes.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Nor if, as some physiologists say, seed being first seethed
and altered in the womb then goes forward to its gaping
vessels as the seeds of the earth go to the earth; why
then, those who do not know the length of time taken by
this change will not know either the moment of conception.
And again, as women differ from one another in energy and
other causes of action in other parts of the body, so do they
differ in the energy of the womb, some conceiving quicker
and others slower. And this is not unexpected, since if
we compare them, they are seen now to be good conceivers
and now not at all so. This being so, it is impossible to
say with exactness when the seed deposited is secured, so
that from this time the Chaldæans may establish the
horoscope<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> of the birth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">p. 59.</div>

<p>4. For this reason it is impossible to establish the horoscope
from the conception; nor can it be done from the
bringing forth. For in the first place, it is very hard to
say when the bringing forth is: whether it is when the
child begins to incline towards the fresh air or when it
projects a little, or when it is brought down altogether to
the ground. But in none of these cases is it possible to
define the time of birth accurately.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> For from presence of
mind and suitableness of body, and through preference of
places and the expertness of the midwife and endless other
causes, the time is not always the same when, the membranes
being ruptured, the infant inclines forward, or when

<span class="sidenote">p. 60.</span>

it projects a little, or when it falls to the ground. But it is
different with different women. Which, again, the Chaldæans
being unable to measure definitely and accurately,
they are prevented from determining as they should the
hour of the bringing forth.</p>

<p>That the Chaldæans, therefore, while asserting that they
know the sign ascending at the time of birth, do not know
it, is plain from the facts. And that there is no means
either of unerringly observing the time,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is easy to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
judged. For when they say that the person sitting by the
woman in labour at the bringing forth signifies the same to
the Chaldæan who is looking upon the stars from a high
place by means of the gong,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and that this last gazing upon
the heaven notes down the sign then rising, we shall show
that as the bringing forth happens at no defined time,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> it is
not possible either to signify the same by the gong. For
even if it be granted that the actual bringing forth can be
ascertained, yet the time cannot be signified accurately.
For the sound of the gong, being capable of divisions by
perception into much and more time,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> it happens that it is

<span class="sidenote">p. 61.</span>

carried (late) to the high place. And the proof of this is
what is noticed when trees are felled a long way off.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> For
the sound of the stroke is heard a pretty long time after
the fall of the axe, so as to reach the listener later. And
from this cause it is impossible for the Chaldæans to
obtain accurately the time of the rising sign and that which
is in truth on the ascendant.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> And indeed not only does
more time pass after the birth before he who sits beside the
woman in labour, strikes the gong, and again after the stroke
before it is heard by him upon the high place, but also
before he can look about and see in which sign is the moon
and in which is each of the other stars. It seems inevitable
then that there must be a great change in the disposition
of the stars,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> [from the movement of the Pole being whirled
along with indescribable swiftness] before the hour of him
who has been born as it is seen in heaven can be observed
carefully.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">p. 62.</div>

<p>5. Thus the art according to the Chaldæans has been
shown to be baseless. But if any one should fancy that by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
enquiries, the geniture<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> of the enquirer is to be learned, we
may know that not in this way either can it be arrived at
with certainty. For if such great care in the practice of the
art is necessary, and yet as we have shown they do not
arrive at accuracy, how can an unskilled person take
accurately the time of birth, so that the Chaldæan on learning
it may set up the horoscope truthfully?<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> But neither
by inspection of the horizon will the star ascending appear
the same everywhere, but sometimes the cadent sign will
be considered the ascendant and sometimes the succeedent,
according as the coming in view of the places is higher or
lower. So that in this respect the prediction will not appear
accurate, many people being born all over the world at the
same hour, while every observer will see the stars differently.</p>

<p>But vain also is the customary taking of the time by
water-jars.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> For the pierced jar will not give the same
flow when full as when nearly empty, while according to

<span class="sidenote">p. 63.</span>

the theory of these people the Pole itself is borne along in
one impulse with equal speed. But if they answer to this
that they do not take the time accurately but as it chances
in common use,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> they will be refuted merely by the starry
influences themselves.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> For those who have been born at
the same time have not lived the same life; but some for
example have reigned as kings while others have grown old
in chains. None at any rate of the many throughout the
inhabited world at the same time as Alexander of Macedon
were like unto him, and none to Plato the philosopher.
So that if the Chaldæan observes carefully the time in
common use, he will not be able to say<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> if he who is born
at that time will be fortunate. For many at any rate born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
at that time, will be unfortunate, so that the likeness
between the genitures is vain.</p>

<p>Having therefore refuted in so many different ways the
vain speculation of the Chaldæans, we shall not omit this,
that their prognostications lead to impossibility. For if he
who is born under the point of Sagittarius’ arrow must be
slain, as the astrologers<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> say, how was it that so many

<span class="sidenote">p. 64.</span>

barbarians who fought against the Greeks at Marathon or
Salamis were killed at the same time? For there was not
at any rate the same horoscope for all. And again, if he
who is born under the urn of Aquarius will be shipwrecked,
how was it that some of the Greeks returning from Troy
were sunk together in the furrows of the Eubœan sea?
For it is incredible that all these differing much from one
another in age should all have been born under Aquarius’
urn. For it cannot be said often that because of one who
was destined to perish by sea, all those in the ship should
be destroyed along with him. For why should the destiny
of this one prevail over that of all, and yet that not all should
be saved because of one who was destined to die on land?</p>

<p>6. But since also they make a theory about the influence
of the zodiacal signs to which they say the things brought
forth are likened, we shall not omit this. For example,
they say that he who is born under Leo will be courageous,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and he who is born under Virgo straight-haired, pale-complexioned,

<span class="sidenote">p. 65.</span>

childless and bashful. But these things and
those like them deserve laughter rather than serious consideration.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
For according to them an Ethiopian can be
born under Virgo, and if so they allow he will be white,
straight-haired and the rest. But I imagine that the
ancients gave the names of the lower animals to the stars
rather because of arbitrariness<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> than from natural likeness
of shape. For what likeness to a bear have the seven stars
which stand separate from one another? Or to the head
of a dragon those five of which Aratus says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Two hold the temples, two the eyes, and one beneath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marks the chin point of the monster dread.&mdash;</div>
<div class="right">(Aratus, <i>Phainomena</i>, vv. 56, 57.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>




<p>7. That these things are not worthy of so much labour
is thus proved to the right-thinkers aforesaid, and to those
who give no heed to the inflated talk of the Chaldæans,
who with assurance of indemnity make kings to disappear

<span class="sidenote">p. 66.</span>

and incite private persons to dare great deeds.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But if he
who has given way to evil fails, he who has been deceived
does not become a teacher to all whose minds the Chaldæans
wish to lead endlessly astray by their failures. For
they constrain the minds of their pupils when they say that
the same configuration of the stars cannot occur otherwise
than by the return of the Great Year in 7777 years.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> How
then can human observation agree<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> in so many ages upon
one geniture? And this not once but many times, since
the destruction of the cosmos as some say will interrupt
the observation, or its gradual transformation will cause to
disappear entirely the continuity of historical tradition.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>]
The Chaldaic art must be refuted by more arguments,
although we have been recalling it to memory on account
of other matters and not for its own sake. But since we
have before said that we will omit none of the opinions
current among the Gentiles,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> by reason of the many-voiced
craft of the heresies, let us see what they say also who have

<span class="sidenote">p. 67.</span>

dared to speculate about magnitudes. Who, recognizing
the variety of the work of most of them, when another has
been utterly deceived in a different manner and has been
yet held in high esteem, have dared to say something yet
more grandiose than he, so that they may be yet more
glorified by those who have already glorified their petty
frauds. These men postulate circles and triangular and
square measures doubly and triply.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> There is much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
theory about this, but it is not necessary for what lies
before us.</p>

<p>8. I reckon it enough therefore to declare the marvels
described by them. Wherefore I shall employ their
epitomes,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> as they call them, and then turn to other things.
They say this:<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> he who fashioned the universe, gave rule
to the revolution of the Same and Like, for that alone he left
undivided; but the inner motion he divided 6 times and
made 7 unequal circles divided by intervals in ratios of 2
and 3, 3 of each, and bade the circles revolve in directions
opposite to one another&mdash;3 of them to revolve at equal
pace, and 4 with a velocity unlike that of the 3, but in

<span class="sidenote">p. 68.</span>

due proportion.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> And he says that rule was given to the
orbit of the 7, not only because it embraces the orbit of
the Other, <i>i. e.</i>, the Wanderers; but because it has so much
rule, <i>i. e.</i>, so much power, that it carries along with it the
Wanderers to the opposite positions, bearing them from
West to East and from East to West by its own strength.
And he says that the same orbit was allowed to be one
and undivided, first because the orbits of all the fixed stars
are equal in time and not divided into greater and lesser
times.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> And next because they all have the same appearance,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
which is that of the outermost orbit, while the
Wanderers are divided into more and different kinds of
movements and into unequal distances from the Earth.
And he says that the Other orbit has been cut in 6 places
into 7 circles according to ratio.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> For as many cuts as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
there are of each, so many segments are there <i>plus</i> a monad.
For example if one cut be made,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> there are 2 segments;
if 2 cuts, 3 segments; and so, if a thing be cut 6 times there

<span class="sidenote">p. 69.</span>

will be 7 segments. And he says that the intervals between
them are arranged alternately in ratios of 2 and 3, 3 of
each, which he has proved with regard to the constitution
of the soul also, as to the 7 numbers. For 3 among them,
viz., 2, 4, 8, are doubles from the monad onwards and 3 of
them, viz., 3, 9, 27 [triples]<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.... But the diameter of the
Earth is 80,008 stadia and its perimeter 250,543.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And
the distance from the Earth’s surface to the circle of the
Moon, Aristarchus of Samos writes as ...<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> stadia but
Apollonius as 5,000,000 and Archimedes as 5,544,130.
And Archimedes says that from the Moon’s circle to that
of the Sun is 50,262,065 stadia; from this to the circle
of Aphrodite 20,272,065; and from this to the circle of
Hermes 50,817,165; and from the same to the circle of

<span class="sidenote">p. 70.</span>

the Fiery One<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> 40,541,108; and from this to the circle of
Zeus 20,275,065; but from this to the circle of Kronos,
40,372,065; and from this to the Zodiac and the last
periphery 20,082,005 stadia.</p>

<p>9. The differences from one another of the circles and
the spheres in height are also given by Archimedes. He
takes the perimeter of the Zodiac at 447,310,000 stadia, so
that a straight line from the centre of the Earth to its
extreme surface is the sixth part of the said number, and
from the surface of the Earth on which we walk to the
Zodiac is exactly one-sixth of the said number less 40,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
stadia which is the distance from the centre of the Earth to
its surface. And from the circle of Kronos to the Earth, he
says, the interval is 2,226,912,711 stadia; and from the

<span class="sidenote">p. 71.</span>

circle of the Fiery One to the Earth, 132,418,581; and from
the Sun to the Earth, 121,604,454; from the Shining One
to the Earth, 526,882,259; and from Aphrodite to the
Earth, 50,815,160.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>10. And about the Moon we have before spoken. The
distances and depths<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of the spheres are thus given by
Archimedes, but Hipparchus speaks differently about them,
and Apollonius the mathematician differently again. But
it is enough for us in following the Platonic theory to think
of the intervals between the Wanderers as in ratios of
2 and 3. For thus is kept alive the theory of the harmonious
construction of the universe in accordant ratios<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> by the
same distances. But the numbers set out by Archimedes and
the ratios quoted by the others concerning the distances, if
they are not in accordant ratios, that is in those called by

<span class="sidenote">p. 72.</span>

Plato twofold and threefold, but are found to be outside
the chords,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> would not keep alive the theory of the harmonious
construction of the universe. For it is neither probable
nor possible that their distances should have no ratio to one
another, that is, should be outside the chords and enharmonic
scales. Except perhaps the Moon alone, from her
waning and the shadows of the Earth, as to which planet
alone you may trust Archimedes, that is to say for the
distance of the Moon from the Earth. And it will be easy
for those who accept this calculation to ascertain the
number and the other distances according to the Platonic
method by doubling and tripling as Plato demands.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
then, according to Archimedes, the Moon is distant from the
Earth 5,544,130 stadia, it will be easy by increasing these
numbers in ratios of 2 and 3 to find her distance from the
rest by taking one fraction of the number of stadia by which
the Moon is distant from the Earth.</p>

<p>But since the rest of the numbers stated by Archimedes
about the distance of the Wanderers are not in accordant
ratios, it is easy to know how they stand in regard to one

<span class="sidenote">p. 73.</span>

another and in what ratios they have been observed to be.
But that the same are not in harmony and accord<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> when
they are parts of the cosmos established by harmony is
impossible. So then, as the first number (of stadia) by
which the Moon is distant from the Earth is 5,544,130, the
second number by which the Sun is distant from the Moon
being 50,262,065, it is in ratio more than ninefold; and the
number of the interval above this being 20,272,065 is in
ratio less than one-half. And the number of the interval
above this being 50,815,108 is in ratio more than twofold.
And the number of the interval above this being 40,541,108
is in ratio more than one and a quarter.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> And the number
of the interval above this being 20,275,065 is in ratio more
than half. And the number of the highest interval above
this being 40,372,065 is in ratio less than twofold.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>11. These same ratios indeed&mdash;the more than ninefold,

<span class="sidenote">p. 74.</span>

less than half, more than twofold, less than one and a quarter,
more than half, less than half and less than twofold are
outside all harmonies and from them no enharmonic nor
accordant system can come to pass. But the whole cosmos
and its parts throughout are put together in an enharmonic
and accordant manner. But the enharmonic and accordant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
ratios are kept alive as we have said before by the twofold
and threefold intervals. If then we deem Archimedes
worthy of faith on the distance given above, <i>i. e.</i>, that from
the Moon to the Earth, it is easy to find the rest by increasing
it in the ratios of 2 and 3. Let the distance from the
Earth to the Moon be, according to Archimedes, 5,544,130
stadia. The double of this will be the number of stadia by
which the Sun is distant from the Moon, viz., 11,088,260.
But from the Earth the Sun is distant 16,632,390 stadia and
Aphrodite indeed from the Sun&mdash;16,632,390 stadia, but
from the Earth 33,264,780. Ares indeed is distant from
Aphrodite 22,176,520 stadia but from the Earth 105,338,470.
But Zeus is distant from Ares 44,353,040 stadia, but from

<span class="sidenote">p. 75</span>

the Earth 149,691,510. Kronos is distant from Zeus
40,691,510 stadia, but from the Earth 293,383,020.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>12. Who will not wonder at so much activity of mind
produced by so great labour? It seems that this Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
who busies himself with these matters is not without his use
to me. This only grieves me that as one but lately born he
was not serviceable to the sons of the giants,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> who, being
ignorant of these measurements, thought they were near
high heaven and began to make a useless tower. Had he
been at hand to explain these measurements to them they
would not have ventured on the foolishness. But if any one
thinks he can disbelieve this let him take the measurements
and be convinced; for one cannot have for the unbelieving
a more manifold proof than this. O puffing-up of vainly-toiling
soul and unbelieving belief, when Ptolemy is considered
wise in everything by those trained in the like
wisdom!<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>13. Certain men in part intent on these things as judging

<span class="sidenote">p. 76.</span>

them mighty and worthy of argument have constructed
measureless<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> and boundless heresies. Among whom is one
Colarbasus,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> who undertakes to set forth religion by
measures and numbers. And there are others whom we
shall likewise point out when we begin to speak of those
who give heed to Pythagorean reckoning as if it were powerful
and neglect the true philosophy for numbers and
elements, thus making vain divinations. Collecting whose
words, certain men have led astray the uneducated, pretending
to know the future and when they chance to divine
one thing aright are not ashamed of their many failures,
but make a boast of their one success. Nor shall I pass
over their unwise wisdom, but when I have set forth their
attempts to establish a religion from these sources, I shall
refute them as being disciples of a school inconsistent and
full of trickery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">p. 77.</div>

<p>Those then who fancy that they can divine by means of
ciphers<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and numbers, elements<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and names, make the
foundation of their attempted system to be this. They
pretend that every number has a root:&mdash;in the thousands
as many units as there are thousands. For example, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
root of 6000 is 6 units, of 7000, 7 units, of 8000, 8 units,
and with the rest in the same way. In the hundreds as
many hundreds as there are, so the same number of units is
the root of them. For example, in 700 there are 7 hundreds:
7 units is their root. In 600 there are 6 hundreds: 6 units is
their root. In the same way in the decads: of 80 the root
is 8 units, of 40, 4 units, of 10, 1 unit. In the units, the units
themselves are the root; for instance, the unit of the 9 is 9, of
the 8, 8, of the 7, 7. Thus then must we do with the component
parts [of names]. For each element is arranged
according to some number. For example, the Nu consists
of 50 units; but of 50 units the root is 5, and of the letter

<span class="sidenote">p. 78.</span>

Nu the root is 5. Let it be granted that from the name we
may take certain<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of its roots. For example, from the name
Agamemnon there comes from the Alpha one unit, from the
Gamma 3 units, from the other Alpha 1 unit, from the Mu 4
units, from the Epsilon 5 units, from the Mu 4 units, from
the Nu 5 units, from the Omega 8 units, from the Nu 5 units,
which together in one row will be 1, 3, 1, 4, 5, 4, 5, 8, 5. These
added together make 36 units. Again they take the roots
of these and they become 3 for the 30, but 6 itself for the
6. Then the 3 and the 6 added together make 9, but the
root of 9 is 9. Therefore the name Agamemnon ends in
the root 9.</p>

<p>Let the same be done with another name, viz., Hector.
The name Hector contains five elements, Epsilon, Kappa,
Tau, Omega and Rho.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The roots of these are 5, 2, 3, 8, 1;
these added together make 19 units. Again, the root of the
10 is 1, of the 9, 9, which added together make 10. The
root of the 10 is one unit. Therefore the name of Hector
when counted up<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> has made as its root one unit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">p. 79.</div>

<p>But it is easier to work this way. Divide by 9 the roots
ascertained from the elements, as we have just found 19
units from the name Hector, and read the remaining root.
For example, if I divide the 19 by 9, there remains a unit,
for twice 9 is 18, and the remainder is a unit. For if I
subtract 18 from the 19, the remainder is a unit. Again, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
the name Patroclus<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> these numbers 8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 2, 3, 7, 2
are the roots; added together they make 34 units. The
remainder of these units is 7, viz., 3 from the 30 and 4
from the 4. Therefore 7 units are the root of the name
Patroclus. Those then who reckon by the rule of 9 take
the 9th part of the number collected from the roots and
describe the remainder as the sum of the roots; but those
who reckon by the rule of 7 take the 7th part. For example,
in the name Patroclus the aggregate of the roots is 34 units.
This divided into sevens makes 4 sevens, which are 28; the

<span class="sidenote">p. 80.</span>

remainder is 6 units. He says that by the rule of 7, 6 is
the root of the name Patroclus.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> If, however, it be 43,
the 7th part, he says, is 42, for 7 times 6 is 42, and the
remainder is 1. Therefore the root from the 43 by the
rule of 7 becomes a unit. But we must take notice of
what happens if the given number when divided has no
remainder,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> as for example, if from one name, after adding
together the roots, I find, <i>e. g.</i>, 36 units. But 36 divided by
9 is exactly 4 enneads (for 9 times 4 is 36 and nothing
over). Thus, he says the 9 itself is plainly the root. If
again we divide the number 45 we find 9 and no remainder
(for 9 times 5 is 45 and nothing over), in such cases we say
the root is 9. And in the same way with the rule of 7: if,
<i>e. g.</i>, we divide 28 by 7 we shall have nothing over (for 7
times 4 is 28 and nothing left), [and] they say the root is 7.
Yet when he reckons up the names and finds the same
letter twice, he counts it only once. For example, the name

<span class="sidenote">p. 81.</span>

Patroclus has the Alpha twice and the Omicron twice,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
therefore he counts the Alpha only once and the
Omicron only once. According to this, then, the roots
will be 8, 3, 1, 7, 2, 3, 2, and added together make 27,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and
the root of the name by the rule of 9 will be the 9 itself and
by that of 7, 6.</p>

<p>In the same way Sarpedon, when counted, makes by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
rule of 9, 2 units; but Patroclus makes 9: Patroclus
conquers. For when one number is odd and the other even,
the odd conquers if it be the greater. But again if there
were an 8, which is even, and a 5, which is odd, the 8
conquers, for it is greater. But if there are two numbers,
for example, both even or both odd, the lesser conquers.
But how does Sarpedon by the rule of 9 make 2 units?
The element Omega is omitted; for when there are in a
name the elements Omega and Eta, they omit the Omega

<span class="sidenote">p. 82.</span>

and use one element. For they say that they both have the
same power, but are not to be counted twice, as has been
said above. Again, Ajax (Αἴας)<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> makes 4 units, and Hector
by the rule of 9 only one. But the 4 is even while the unit
is odd. And since we have said that in such cases the
greater conquers, Ajax is the victor. Take again Alexandros<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
and Menelaus. Alexandros has an individual<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
name [Paris]. The name Paris makes by the rule of 9, 4;
Menelaus by the same rule 9, and the 9 conquers the 4.
For it has been said that when one is odd and the other
even, the greater conquers, but when both are even or both
odd, the lesser. Take again Amycus and Polydeuces.
Amycus makes by the rule of 9, 2 units, and Polydeuces 7:
Polydeuces conquers. Ajax and Odysseus contended
together in the funereal games. Ajax makes by the rule of
9, 4 units, and Odysseus by the same rule 8.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Is there not
(here) then some epithet of Odysseus and not his individual
name, for he conquered? According to the numbers Ajax
conquers, but tradition says Odysseus. Or take again
Achilles and Hector. Achilles by the rule of 9 makes 4;

<span class="sidenote">p. 83.</span>

Hector 1; Achilles conquers. Take again Achilles and
Asteropæus. Achilles makes 4, Asteropæus 3;<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Achilles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
conquers. Take again Euphorbus and Menelaus. Menelaus
has 9 units, Euphorbus 8; Menelaus conquers.</p>

<p>But some say that by the rule of 7, they use only the
vowels, and others that they put the vowels, semi-vowels
and consonants by themselves, and interpret each column
separately. But yet others do not use the usual numbers,
but different ones. Thus, for example, they will not have
Pi to have as a root 8 units, but 5 and the element Xi as a
root 4 units; and turning about every way, they discover
nothing sane. When, however, certain competitors contend
a second time,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> they take away the first element, and when
a third, the two first elements of each, and counting up the
rest, they interpret them.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 84.</span>2. I should think that the design of the arithmeticians
has been plainly set forth, who deem that by numbers and
names they can judge life. And I notice that, as they
have time to spare and have been trained in counting, they
have wished by means of the art handed down to them by
children to proclaim themselves well-approved diviners,
and, measuring the letters topsy-turvy, have strayed into
nonsense. For when they fail to hit the mark, they say in
propounding the difficulty that the name in question is not
a family name but an epithet; as also they plead as a subterfuge
in the case of Ajax and Odysseus. Who that founds
his tenets on this wonderful philosophy and wishes to be
called heresiarch, will not be glorified?</p>

<p>1. But since there is another and more profound art
among the all-wise investigators of the Greeks, whose disciples
the heretics profess themselves because of the use they
make of their opinions for their own designs, as we shall
show before long, we shall not keep silence about this.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
This is the divination or rather madness by metoposcopy.

<span class="sidenote">p. 85.</span>

There are those who refer to the stars the forms of the
types and patterns<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and natures of men, summing them
up by their births under certain stars. This is what they
say: Those born under Aries will be like this, to wit,
long-headed, red-haired, with eyebrows joined together,
narrow forehead, sea-green eyes, hanging cheeks, long nose,
expanded nostrils, thin lips, pointed chin, and wide mouth.
They will partake, he says, of such a disposition as this:
forethinking, versatile, cowardly, provident, easy-going,
gentle, inquisitive, concealing their desires, equipped for
everything, ruling more by judgment than by strength,
laughing at the present, skilled writers, faithful, lovers of
strife, provoking to controversy, given to desire, lovers of
boys, understanding, turning from their own homes, displeased

<span class="sidenote">p. 86.</span>

with everything, litigious, madmen in their cups,
contemptuous, casting away somewhat every year, useful in
friendship by their goodness. Most often they die in a
foreign land.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>2. Those born under Taurus will be of this type: round-headed,
coarse-haired, with broad forehead, oblong eyes
and great eyebrows if dark; if fair, thin veins, sanguine
complexion, large and heavy eyelids, great ears, round
mouth, thick nose, widely-open nostrils, thick lips. They
are strong in their upper limbs, but are sluggish from the
hips downwards from their birth. The same are of a disposition
pleasing, understanding, naturally clever, religious,
just, rustical, agreeable, laborious<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> after twelve years old,
easily irritated, leisurely. Their appetite is small, they are
quickly satisfied, wishing for many things, provident, thrifty
towards themselves, liberal towards others; as a class they
are sorrowful, useless in friendship, useful because of their
minds, enduring ills.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 87.</span>3. The type of these under Gemini: red-faced, not too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
tall in stature, even-limbed, eyes black and beady,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> cheeks
drawn downwards, coarse mouth, eyebrows joined together.
They rule all that they have, are rich at the last, niggardly,
thrifty of their own, profuse in the affairs of Venus, reasonable,
musical, cheats. The same are said (by other writers)
to be of this disposition: learned, understanding, inquisitive,
self-assertive, given to desire, thrifty with their own, liberal,
gentle, prudent, crafty, wishing for many things, calculators,
litigious, untimely, not lucky. They are beloved by women,
are traders, but not very useful in friendship.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 88.</span>4. The type of those under Cancer: not great in stature,
blue-black hair, reddish complexion, small mouth, round
head, narrow forehead, greenish eyes, sufficiently beautiful,
limbs slightly irregular. Their disposition: evil, crafty,
skilled in plots, insatiable, thrifty, ungraced, servile, unhelpful,
forgetful. They neither give back what is another’s
nor demand back their own; useful in friendship.</p>

<p>5. The type of those under Leo: round head, reddish
hair, large wrinkled forehead, thick ears, stiff-necked, partly
bald, fiery complexion, green-gray eyes, large jaws, coarse
mouth, heavy upper limbs, great breast, lower parts small.
Their disposition is: self-assertive, immoderate, self-pleasers,
wrathful, courageous, scornful, arrogant, never deliberating,
no talkers, indolent, addicted to custom, given up to the
things of Venus, fornicators, shameless, wanting in faith,
importunate for favour, audacious, niggardly, rapacious,
celebrated, helpful to the community, useless in friendship.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 89.</span>6. The type of those under Virgo: with fair countenance,
eyes not great but charming, with dark eyebrows close
together, vivacious and swimming.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But they are slight in
body, fair to see, with hair beautifully thick, large forehead,
prominent nose. Their disposition is: quick at learning,
moderate, thoughtful, playful, erudite, slow of speech, planning

<p>13. Since we have set forth their wonderful wisdom, and
have not concealed their much-laboured art of divination
by intelligence,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> neither shall we be silent on the folly into

<span class="sidenote">p. 93.</span>

which their mistakes in these matters lead them. For how
feeble are they in finding a parallel between the names of
the stars and the forms and dispositions of men? For we
know that those who at the outset chanced upon the stars,
naming them according to their own fancy, called them by
names for the purpose of easily and clearly recognizing
them. For what likeness is there in these names to the
appearance of the Zodiacal signs, or what similar nature
of working and activity, so that any one born under
Leo should be thought courageous,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> or he who is born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
under Virgo moderate, or under Cancer bad, and those
under<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>....</p>


<h3 id="IV_4" title="4. The Magicians.">4. <i>The Magicians.</i><a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></h3>

<p>(The gap here caused by the mutilation of the MS. was
probably filled by a description of the mode of divination
by enquiry of a spirit or dæmon which was generally made
in writing, as Lucian describes in his account of the imposture
of Alexander of Abonoteichos. The MS. proceeds.)</p>

<p>... And he (<i>i. e.</i>, the magician) taking some paper, orders
the enquirer to write down what it is he wishes to enquire
of the dæmons.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Then he having folded up the paper and
given it to the boy,<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> sends it away to be burned so that the
smoke carrying the letters may go hence to the dæmons.
But while the boy is doing what he is commanded, he first
tears off equal parts of the paper, and on some other parts

<span class="sidenote">p. 94.</span>

of it, he pretends that the dæmons write in Hebrew letters.
Then having offered up the Egyptian magicians’ incense
called Cyphi,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> he scatters these pieces of paper over the
offering. But what the enquirer may have chanced to write
having been put on the coals is burned. Then, seeming to
be inspired by a god, the magician rushes into the inner
chamber<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> with a loud and discordant cry unintelligible to
all. But he bids all present to enter and cry aloud,
invoking Phrēn<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> or some other dæmon. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
spectators have entered and are standing by, he flings the
boy on a couch and reads to him many things, sometimes
in the Greek tongue, sometimes in the Hebrew, which are
the incantations usual among magicians. And having made
libation, he begins the sacrifice. And he having put copperas<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
in the libation bowl<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and when the drug is dissolved
sprinkling with it the paper which had forsooth been
discharged of writing, he compels the hidden and concealed
letters again to come to light, whereby he learns what the
enquirer has written.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 95.</span>And if one writes with copperas and fumigates it with a
powdered gall-nut, the hidden letters will become clear.
Also if one writes (with milk) and the paper is burned and
the ash sprinkled on the letters written with the milk, they
will be manifest.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> And urine and garum<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> also and juice of
the spurge and of the fig will have the same effect.</p>

<p>But when he has thus learned the enquiry, he thinks
beforehand in what fashion he need reply. Then he bids
the spectators come inside bearing laurel-branches and
shaking them<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and crying aloud invocations to the dæmon
Phrēn. For truly it is fitting that he should be invoked by
them and worthy that they should demand from dæmons
what they do not wish to provide on their own account,
seeing that they have lost their brains.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> But the confusion
of the noise and the riot prevents them following what the
magician is thought to do in secret. What this is, it is time
to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>Now it is very dark at this point. For he says that it is
impossible for mortal nature to behold the things of the
gods, for it is enough to talk with them. But having made
the boy lie down on his face, with two of those little
writing tablets on which are written in Hebrew letters

<span class="sidenote">p. 96.</span>

forsooth<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> such things as names of dæmons, on each side of
him, he says (the god) will convey the rest into the boy’s
ears. But this is necessary to him, in order that he may
apply to the boy’s ears a certain implement whereby he can
signify to him all that he wishes. And first he rings<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> (a
gong) so that the boy may be frightened, and secondly he
makes a humming noise, and then thirdly he speaks through
the implement what he wishes the boy to say, and watches
carefully the effect of the act. Thereafter he makes the
spectators keep silence, but bids the boy repeat what he has
heard from the dæmons. But the implement which is
applied to the ears is a natural one, to wit, the wind-pipe of
the long-necked cranes or storks or swans. If none of
these is at hand, the art has other means at its disposal.

<span class="sidenote">p. 97.</span>

For certain brass pipes, fitting one into the other and ending
in a point are well suited to the purpose through which
anything the magician wishes may be spoken into the ears.
And these things the boy hearing utters when bidden in a
fearful way, as if they were spoken by dæmons. And if
one wraps a wet hide round a rod and having dried it and
bringing the edges together fastens them closely, and then
taking out the rod, makes the hide into the form of a pipe,
it has the same effect. And if none of these things is at
hand, he takes a book and, drawing out from the inside as
much as he requires, pulls it out lengthways and acts in the
same way.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>But if he knows beforehand that any one present will ask
a question, he is better prepared for everything. And if he
has learned the question beforehand he writes it out with
the drug (aforesaid) and as being prepared is thought more
adept for having skilfully written what was about to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
asked. But if he does not know, he guesses at it, and
exhibits some roundabout phrase of double and various
meaning, so that the answer of the oracle being meaningless
will do for many things at the beginning, but at the end of
the events will be thought a prediction of what has happened.

<span class="sidenote">p. 98.</span>

Then having filled a bowl with water, he puts at the bottom
of it the paper with apparently nothing written on it, but at
the same time putting in the copperas. For thus there
floats to the surface the paper bearing the answer which he
has written. To the boy also there often come fearful
fancies; for truly the magician strikes blows in abundance
to terrify him. For, again casting incense into the fire, he
acts in this fashion. Having covered a lump of the so-called
quarried salts<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> with Tyrrhenian wax and cutting in
halves the lump of incense, he puts between them a lump
of the salt and again sticking them together throws them on
the burning coals and so leaves them. But when the
incense is burnt, the salts leaping up produce an illusion as
if some strange and wonderful thing were happening. But
indigo black<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> put in the incense produces a blood-red
flame as we have before said.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And he makes a liquid
like blood by mixing wax with rouge and as I have said,
putting the wax in the incense. And he makes the coals to
move by putting under them stypteria<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> cut in pieces, and
when it melts and swells up like bubbles, the coals are
moved.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 99.</span>2. And they exhibit eggs different (from natural ones) in
this way. Having bored a hole in the apex at each end
and having extracted the white, and again plunged the egg in
boiling water, put in either red earth from Sinope<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> or
writing ink. But stop up the holes with pounded eggshell
made into a paste with the juice of a fig.</p>

<p>3. This is the way they make sheep cut off their own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
heads. Secretly anointing the sheep’s throat with a caustic
drug, he fixes near the beast a sword and leaves it there.
But the sheep, being anxious to scratch himself, leans (heavily)
on the knife, rubs himself along it, kills himself and must
needs almost cut off his head. And the drug is bryony and
marsh salt and squills in equal parts mixed together. So
that he may not be seen to have the drug with him, he
carries a horn box made double, the visible part of which
holds frankincense and the invisible the drug. And he also
puts quicksilver into the ears of the animal that is to die.
But this is a death-dealing drug.</p>

<p>4. But if one stops up the ears of goats with salve, they
say they will shortly die because prevented from breathing.

<span class="sidenote">p. 100.</span>

For they say that this is with them the way in which the
intaken air is breathed forth. And they say that a ram dies
if one should bend him backwards against the sun.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> But
they make a house catch fire by anointing it with the ichor
of a certain animal called dactylus;<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and this is very useful
because of sea-water. And there is a sea-foam heated in an
earthen jar with sweet substances, which if you apply to it a
lighted lamp catches fire and is inflamed, but does not burn
at all if poured on the head. But if you sprinkle it with
melted gum, it catches fire much better; and it does better
still if you also add sulphur to it.</p>

<p>5. Thunder is produced in very many ways. For very
many large stones rolled from a height over wooden planks
and falling upon sheets of brass make a noise very like
thunder. And they coil a slender cord round the thin

<span class="sidenote">p. 101.</span>

board on which the wool-carders press cloth, and then spin
the board by whisking away the string when the whirring of
it makes the sound of thunder. These tricks they play
thus; but there are others which I shall set forth which
those who play them also consider great. Putting a cauldron
full of pitch upon burning coals, when it boils they plunge
their hands in it and are not burned; and further they tread
with naked feet upon coals of fire and are not burned. And
also putting a pyramid of stone upon the altar, they make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
it burn and from its mouth it pours forth much smoke and
fire. Then laying a linen cloth upon a pan of water and
casting upon it many burning coals, the linen remains unburnt.
And having made darkness in the house, the magician
claims to make gods or dæmons enter in, and if one somehow
asks that Esculapius shall be displayed he makes
invocation, saying thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Apollo’s son, once dead and again undying!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I call on thee to come as a helper to my libations.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>6. But when he has made an end of this mockery a fiery
Esculapius appears on the floor. Then having put in the
midst a bowl of water,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> he invokes all the gods and they
are at hand. For if the spectator lean over and gaze into
the bowl, he will see all the gods and Artemis leading on

<span class="sidenote">p. 103.</span>

her baying hounds. But we shall not hesitate to tell the
story of these things and how they undertake them. For
the magician plunges his hands in the cauldron of pitch
which appears to be boiling; but he throws into it vinegar
and soda<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and moist pitch and heats the cauldron gently.
And the vinegar having mingled with the soda, on getting
a little hot, moves the pitch so as to bring bubbles to the
surface and gives the appearance of boiling only. But the
magician has washed his hands many times in sea-water,
thanks to which it does not burn him much if it be really
boiling. And if he has after washing them anointed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
hands with myrtle-juice and soda and myrrh<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> mixed with
vinegar he is not burned (at all). But the feet are not
burned if he anoints them with icthyokolla and salamander.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
And this is the true cause of the pyramid flaming like a
torch, although it is of stone. A paste of Cretan earth<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> is
moulded into the shape of a pyramid,&mdash;but the colour is like
a milk-white stone,&mdash;in this fashion. He has soaked the
piece of earth in much oil, has put it on the coals, and when
heated, has again soaked it and heated it a second and third
time and many a time afterwards, whereby he so prepares

<span class="sidenote">p. 104.</span>

it that it will burn even if plunged in water; for it holds
much oil within itself. But the altar catches fire when the
magician is making libation, because it contains freshly-burned
lime instead of ashes and finely-powdered frankincense
and much ... and of ... of anointed torches and
self-flowing and hollow nutshells having fire within them.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
But he also sends forth smoke from his mouth after a brief
delay by putting fire into a nutshell and wrapping it in tow and
blowing it in his mouth.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> The linen cloth laid on the bowl
of water whereon he puts the coals is not burned, because of
the sea-water underneath, and its being itself steeped in sea-water
and then anointed with white of egg and a solution of
alum. And if also one mixes with this the juice of evergreens
and vinegar and a long time beforehand anoint it
copiously with these, after being dipped in the drug it
remains altogether incombustible.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>7. Since then we have briefly set forth what can be done
with the teachings which they suppose to be secret, we have

<span class="sidenote">p. 105.</span>

displayed their easy system according to Gnosis.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Nor do
we wish to keep silence as to this necessary point, that is,
how they unseal letters and again restore them with the
same seals (apparently intact). Melting pitch, resin, sulphur
and also bitumen in equal parts, and moulding it into the
form of a seal impression, they keep it by them. But when
the opportunity for unsealing a letter<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> arrives, they moisten
the tongue with oil, lick the seal, and warming the drug
before a slow fire press the seal upon it and leave it there
until it is altogether set, when they use it after the manner
of a signet. But they say also that wax with pine resin has
the same effect and so also 2 parts of mastic with 1 of
bitumen. And sulphur alone does fairly well and powdered
gypsum diluted with water and gum.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> This certainly does
most beautifully for sealing molten lead. And the effect of

<span class="sidenote">p. 106.</span>

Tyrrhenian wax and shavings of resin and pitch, bitumen,
mastic and powdered marble in equal parts all melted
together, is better than that of the other (compounds) of
which I have spoken, but that of the gypsum is no worse.
Thus then they undertake to break the seals when seeking
to learn what is written within them. These contrivances I
shrank from setting out in the book,<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> seeing that some ill-doer
taking hints from them<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> might attempt (to practise)
them. But now the care of many young men capable of
salvation has persuaded me to teach and declare them for
the sake of protection (against them). For as one person
will use them for the teaching of evil, so another by learning
them will be protected (against them) and the very magicians,
corruptors of life as they are, will be ashamed to practise
the art. But learning that the same (tricks) have been
taught beforehand, they will perhaps be hindered in their
perverse foolishness. In order, however, that the seal may
not be broken in this way, let any one seal with swine’s fat
and mix hairs with the wax.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>8. Nor shall I be silent about their lecanomancy<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> which
is an imposture. For having prepared some closed chamber

<span class="sidenote">p. 107.</span>

and having painted its ceiling with cyanus, they put into it
for the purpose certain utensils of cyanus<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and fix them
upright. But in the midst a bowl filled with water is
set on the earth, which with the reflection of the cyanus
falling upon it shows like the sky. But there is a certain
hidden opening in the floor over which is set the bowl, the
bottom of which is glass, but is itself made of stone. But
there is underneath a secret chamber in which those in the
farce<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> assembling present the dressed-up forms of the gods
and dæmons which the magician wishes to display. Beholding
whom from above the deceived person is confounded
by the magicians’ trickery and for the rest believes everything
which (the officiator) tells him. And (this last) makes
(the figure of) the dæmon burn by drawing on the wall the
figure he wishes, and then secretly anointing it with a drug
compounded in this way ...<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> with Laconian and Zacynthian
bitumen. Then as if inspired by Phœbus, he brings
the lamp near the wall, and the drug having caught light is
on fire.</p>

<p>But he manages that a fiery Hecate should appear to be
flying through the air thus: Having hidden an accomplice
in what place he wills, and taking the dupes on one side,
he prevails on them by saying that he will show them the

<span class="sidenote">p. 108.</span>

fiery dæmon riding through the air. To whom he announces
that when they see the flame in the air, they must quickly
save their eyes by falling down and hiding their faces until
he shall call them. And having thus instructed them, on a
moonless night, he declaims these verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>9. While he speaks thus, fire is seen borne through the
air, and the spectators terrified by the strangeness of the
sight, cover their eyes and cast themselves in silence on the
earth. But the greatness of the art contains this device.

The accomplice, hidden as I have said, when he hears the
incantation drawing to a close, holding a hawk or kite
wrapped about with tow, sets fire to it and lets it go. And
the bird scared by the flame is carried into the height
and makes very speedy flight. Seeing which, the fools hide
themselves as if they had beheld something divine. But
the winged one whirled about by the fire, is borne whither
it may chance and burns down now houses and now farm-buildings.
Such is the prescience of the magicians.</p>

<p>10. But they show the moon and stars appearing on the
ceiling in this way. Having previously arranged in the
centre part of the ceiling a mirror, and having placed a
bowl filled with water in a corresponding position in the
middle of the earthen floor, but a lamp showing dimly<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
has been placed between them and above the bowl, he
thus produces the appearance of the moon from the
reflection by means of the mirror. But often the magician
hangs aloft<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> near the ceiling a drum on end, the same
being kept covered by the accomplice by some cloth so
that it may not show before its time; and a lamp having
been put behind it, when he makes the agreed signal to the
accomplice, the last-named takes away so much of the

<span class="sidenote">p. 110.</span>

covering as will give a counterfeit of the moon in her form
at that time.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> But he anoints the transparent parts of the
drum with cinnabar and gum....<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> And having cut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
off the neck and bottom of a glass flask, he puts a lamp
within and places around it somewhat of the things necessary
for the figures shining through, which one of the accomplices
has concealed on high. After receiving the signal,
this last lets fall the contrivances from the receptacle hung
aloft, so that the moon appears to have been sent down
from heaven. And the like effect is produced by means of
jars in glass-like forms.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> And it is by means of the jar
that the trick is played within doors. For an altar having
been set up, the jar containing a lighted lamp stands behind
it; but there being many more lamps (about), this nowise
appears. When therefore the enchanter invokes the moon,
he orders all the lamps to be put out, but one is left dim
and then the light from the jar is reflected on to the ceiling
and gives the illusion of the moon to the spectators, the

<span class="sidenote">p. 111.</span>

mouth of the jar being kept covered for the time
which seems to be required that the image of the
crescent moon may be shown on the ceiling.</p>

<p>11. But the scales of fishes or of the “hippurus”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> make
stars seem to be when they are moistened with water and
gum and stuck upon the ceiling here and there.</p>

<p>12. And they create the illusion of an earthquake, so
that everything appears to be moving, ichneumon’s dung
being burned upon coal with magnetic iron ore<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>....</p>

<p>13. But they display a liver appearing to bear an
inscription. On his left hand (the magician) writes what he
wishes, adapting it to the enquiry, and the letters are written
with nut-galls and strong vinegar. Then taking up the liver,
which rests in his left hand, he makes some delay, and it
receives the impression and is thought to have been
inscribed.</p>

<p>14. And having placed a skull on the earth, they make
it speak in this fashion. It is made out of the omentum of

<span class="sidenote">p. 112.</span>

an ox,<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> moulded with Tyrrhenian wax and gypsum and
when it is made and covered with the membrane, it shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
the semblance of a skull. The which seems to speak by
the use of the implement and in the way we have before
explained in the case of the boys. Having prepared the
wind-pipe of a crane or some such long-necked bird and
putting it secretly into the skull, the accomplice speaks
what (the magician) wishes. And when he wants it to
vanish, he appears to offer incense and putting round it
a quantity of coals the wax receiving the heat of which
melts, and thus the skull is thought to have become
invisible.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>15. These and ten thousand such are the works of the
magicians, which, by the suitableness of the verses and
of the belief-inspiring acts performed, beguile the fancy of
the thoughtless. The heresiarchs struck with the arts of
these (magicians) imitate them, handing down some of
their doctrines in secrecy and darkness, but paraphrasing
others as if they were their own. Thanks to this, as we
wish to remind the public, we have been the more anxious
to leave behind us no place for those who wish to go
astray. But we have been led away not without reason
into certain secrets of the magicians which were not

<span class="sidenote">p. 113.</span>

altogether necessary for the subject,<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> but which were
thought useful as a safeguard against the rascally and
inconsistent art of the magicians. Since, now, as far as
one can guess,<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> we have set forth the opinions of all,
having bestowed much care on making it clear that the
things which the heresiarchs have introduced into religion
as new are vain and spurious, and probably are not even
among themselves thought worthy of discussion, it seems
proper to us to recall briefly and summarily what has been
before said.</p>


<h3 id="IV_5">5. <i>Recapitulation.</i></h3>

<p>1. Among all the philosophers and theologists<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> who are
enquiring into the matter throughout the inhabited world,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
there is no agreement concerning God, as to what He is or
whence (He came).<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> For some say that He is fire, some
spirit, some water, others earth. But every one of these
elements contains something inferior and some of them are
defeated by the others. But this has happened to the
world’s sages, which indeed is plain to those who think,

<span class="sidenote">p. 114.</span>

that in view of the greatness of creation, they are puzzled
as to the substance of the things which are, deeming them
too great for it to be possible for them to have received
birth from another. Nor yet do they represent the universe
itself taken collectively<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> to be God. But in speculation
about God every one thought of something which he
preferred among visible things as the Cause. And thus
gazing upon the things produced by God and on those
which are least in comparison with His exceeding greatness,
but not being capable of extending their mind to the real
God, they declared these things to be divine.</p>

<p>The Persians, however, deeming that they were further
within the truth (than the rest) said that God was a shining
light comprised in air. But the Babylonians said that darkness
was God, which appears to be the sequence of the
other opinion; for day follows night and night day.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>2. But the Egyptians, deeming themselves older than all,
have subjected the power of God to ciphers,<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> and calculating
the intervals of the fates by Divine inspiration<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> said that God

<span class="sidenote">p. 115.</span>

was a monad both indivisible and itself begetting itself, and
that from this (monad) all things were made. For it, they
say, being unbegotten, begets the numbers after it; for
example, the monad added to itself begets the dyad, and
added in the like way the triad and tetrad up to the decad,
which is the beginning and the end of the numbers. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
that the monad becomes the first and tenth through the
decad being of equal power and being reckoned as a monad,
and the same being decupled becomes a hecatontad and
again is a monad, and the hecatontad when decupled will
make a chiliad, and it again will be a monad. And thus
also the chiliads if decupled will complete the myriad and
likewise will be a monad. But the numbers akin to the
monad by indivisible comparison are ascertained to be
3, 5, 7, 9.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> There is, however, also a more natural affinity of
another number with the monad which is that by the operation
of the spiral of 6 circles<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> of the dyad according to the

<span class="sidenote">p. 116.</span>

even placing and separation of the numbers. But the kindred
number is of the 4 and 8. And these receiving added
virtue from numbers of the monad, advanced up to the four
elements, I mean spirit and fire, water and earth. And
having created from these the masculo-feminine cosmos,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
he prepared and arranged two elements in the upper hemisphere,
(to wit) spirit and fire, and he called this the
beneficent hemisphere of the monad and the ascending and
the masculine. For the monad, being subtle, flies to the
most subtle and purest part of the æther. The two other
elements being denser, he assigns to the dyad (to wit) earth
and water, and he calls this the descending hemisphere and
feminine and maleficent. And again the two upper elements
when compounded with themselves have in themselves the
male and the female for the fruitfulness and increase of
the universals. And the fire is masculine, but the spirit
feminine: and again the water is masculine and the earth
feminine.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> And thus from the beginning the fire lived with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
the spirit and the water with the earth. For as the power
of the spirit is the fire, so also (the power) of the earth is
the water....</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 117.</span>And the same elements counted and resolved by subtraction
of the enneads,<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> properly end some in the male
number, others in the female. But again the ennead is
subtracted for this cause, because the 360 degrees of the
whole circle consist of enneads, and hence the 4 quarters
of the cosmos are (each) circumscribed by 90 complete
degrees. But the light is associated with the monad and
the darkness with the dyad, and naturally life with the light
and death with the dyad, and justice with life and injustice
with death. Whence everything engendered among the
male numbers is benefic, and (everything engendered)
among the female numbers is malefic. For example, they
reckon that the monad&mdash;so that we may begin from this&mdash;becomes
361, which ends in a monad, the ennead(s) being
subtracted. Reckon in the same way: the dyad becomes
605; subtract the enneads, it ends in a dyad and each is
(thus) carried back to its own.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>3. With the monad, then, as it is benefic, there are

<span class="sidenote">p. 118.</span>

associated names which end in the uneven number,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and
they say that they are ascending and male and benefic when
observed; but that those which end in an even number are
considered descending and female and malefic. For they
say that nature consists of opposites, to wit, good and bad,
as right and left, light and darkness, night and day, life and
death. And they say this besides: that they have calculated
the name of God and that it results in a pentad [or in an
ennead],<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> which is uneven and which written down and
wrapped about the sick works cures. And thus a certain
plant (whose name) ends in this number when tied on in
the same way is effective by the like reckoning of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
number. But a doctor also cures the sick by a like calculation.
But if the calculation be contrary, he does not make
cures easily. Those who give heed to these numbers count
all numbers like it which have the same meaning, some

<span class="sidenote">p. 119.</span>

according to the vowels alone, others according to the total
of the numbers.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Such is the wisdom of the Egyptians,
whereby, while glorifying the Divine, they think they understand
it.</p>


<h3 id="IV_6" title="6. Of the Divination by Astronomy.">6. <i>Of the Divination by Astronomy.</i><a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></h3>

<p>We seem then to have set forth these things also sufficiently.
But since I consider that not one tenet of this earthy and
grovelling wisdom has been passed over, I perceive that
our care with regard to the same things has not been useless.
For we see that our discourse has been of great use not only
for the refutation of heresies, but also against those who
magnify these things.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Those who happen to notice the manifold
care taken by us will both wonder at our zeal and will
neither despise our painstaking nor denounce Christians as
fools when they see what themselves have foolishly believed.
And besides this, the discourse will timely instruct those
lovers of learning who give heed to the truth, making them
more wise to easily overthrow those who have dared to
mislead them&mdash;for they will have learned not only the principles
of the heresies, but also the so-called opinions of the

<span class="sidenote">p. 120.</span>

sages. Not being unacquainted with which, they will not
be confused by them as are the unlearned, nor misled by
some who exercise a certain power, but will keep a watch
upon those who go astray.</p>

<p>2. Having therefore sufficiently set forth (our) opinions,
it remains for us to proceed to the subject aforesaid, when,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
after we have proved what we arranged concerning the
heresies, and have forced the heresiarchs to restore to everyone
his own, we shall exhibit (these heresiarchs) stripped
(of all originality) and by denouncing the folly of their
dupes we shall persuade them to return again to the precious
haven of the truth. But in order that what has been said
may appear more clearly to the readers,<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> it seems to us well
to state the conclusions of Aratus as to the disposition of
the stars in the heaven. For there are some who by likening
them to the words of the Scriptures turn them into
allegories and seek to divert the minds of those who listen
to them by leading them with persuasive words whither
they wish, and pointing out to them strange marvels like
those of the transfers to the stars<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> alleged by them. They
who while gazing upon the outlandish wonder are caught by
their admiration for trifles are like the bird called the owl,<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>

<span class="sidenote">p. 121.</span>

whose example it will be well to narrate in view of what
follows. Now this animal presents no very different appearance
from that of the eagle whether in size or shape; but it is
caught in this way. The bird-catcher, when he sees a flock
alighting anywhere, claps his hands, pretends to dance, and
thus gradually draws near to the birds; but they, struck
by the unwonted sight, become blind to everything else.
Others of the party, however, who are ready on the ground
coming behind the birds easily capture them while they are
staring at the dancer. Wherefore I ask that no one who
is struck by the wonders of whose who interpret the heaven
shall be taken in like the owl. For the dancing and nonsense
of such (interpreters) is trickery and not truth. Now
Aratus speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Many and like are they, going hither and thither,</div>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 122.</span>3. He says that the stars in heaven are πολέας, that is,
turning,<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> because of their going about ceaselessly from East
to West and from West to East in a spherical figure. But
he says there is coiled round the Bears themselves, like the
stream of some river, a great marvel of a terrible dragon,
and this it is, he says, that the Devil in the (Book of) Job
says to God: “I have been walking to and fro under heaven
and going round about,”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> that is, turning hither and thither
and inspecting what is happening. For they consider that
the Dragon is set below the Arctic Pole, from this highest
pole gazing upon all things and beholding all things, so that
none of those that are done shall escape him. For though
all the stars in the heaven can set, this Pole alone never
sets, but rising high above the horizon inspects all things
and beholds all things, and nothing of what is done, he says,
can escape him.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="sidenote">p. 123.</span>he says, indeed, that his head is set. For over against the
rising and setting of the two hemispheres lies the head of
Draco, so that, he says, nothing escapes him immediately
either of things in the West or of things in the East, but the
Beast knows all things at once. And there over against
the very head of Draco is the form of a man made visible by
reason of the stars, which Aratus calls “a wearied image,”
and like one in toil; but he names it the “Kneeler.”<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
Now Aratus says that he does not know what this toil is
and this marvel which turns in heaven. But the heretics,
wishing to found their own tenets on the story of the stars,
and giving their minds very carefully to these things, say<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
that the Kneeler is Adam, as Moses said, according to the
decree of God guarding the head of the Dragon and the
Dragon (guarding) his heel.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> For thus says Aratus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Holding the sole of the right foot of winding Draco.”&mdash;</div>

<p>4. But he says there are placed on either side of him (I
mean the Kneeler) Lyra and Corona; but that he bends
the knee and stretches forth both hands as if making confession

<span class="sidenote">p. 124.</span>

of sin.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> And that the lyre is a musical instrument
fashioned by the Logos in extreme infancy. But that
Hermes is called among the Greeks Logos. And Aratus
says about the fashioning of the lyre:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“which, while he was yet in his cradle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hermes bored and said it was to be called lyre.”&mdash;</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">It is seven-stringed, and indicates by its seven strings the
entire harmony and constitution with which the cosmos is
suitably provided. For in six days the earth came into being
and there was rest on the seventh. If, then, he says,<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Adam
making confession and guarding the head of the Beast according
to God’s decree, will imitate the lyre, that is, will follow
the word of God, which is to obey the Law, he will attain the
Crown lying beside it. But if he takes no heed, he will be
carried downwards along with the Beast below him, and
will have his lot, he says, with the Beast. But the Kneeler
seems to stretch forth his hands on either side and here to
grasp the Lyre and there the Crown [and this is to make confession],<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>

<span class="sidenote">p. 125.</span>

as is to be seen from the very posture. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Crown is plotted against and at the same time drawn away
by another Beast, Draco the Less, who is the offspring of
the one which is guarded by the foot of the Kneeler. But
(another) man stands firmly grasping with both hands
the Serpent, and draws him backwards from the Crown,
and does not permit the Beast to forcibly seize it. Him
Aratus calls Serpent-holder,<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> because he restrains the rage
of the Serpent striving to come at the Crown. But
he, he says, who in the shape of man forbids the Beast
to come at the Crown is Logos, who has mercy upon
him who is plotted against by Draco and his offspring at
once.</p>

<p>And these Bears, he says, are two hebdomads, being made
up of seven stars each, and are images of the two creations.
For the First Creation, he says, is that according to Adam
in his labours who is seen as the Kneeler. But the Second
Creation is that according to Christ whereby we are born

<span class="sidenote">p. 126.</span>

again. He is the Serpent-holder fighting the Beast and
preventing him from coming at the Crown prepared for
man. But Helica<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> is the Great Bear, he says, the symbol
of the great creation, whereby Greeks sail, that is by which
they are taught, and borne onwards by the waves of life
they follow it, such a creation being a certain revolution<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
or schooling or wisdom, leading back again those who follow
such (to the point whence they started). For the name
Helica seems to be a certain turning and circling back to
the same position. But there is also another Lesser Bear,
as it were an image of the Second Creation created by God.
For few, he says, are they who travel by this narrow way.
For they say that Cynosura is narrow, by which, Aratus says,
the Sidonians navigate.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> But Aratus in turn says the
Sidonians are Phœnicians on account of the wisdom of the
Phœnicians being wonderful. But they say that the Greeks
are Phœnicians who removed from the Red Sea to the land

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>

<span class="sidenote">p. 127.</span>

where they now dwell. For thus it seemed to Herodotus.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
But this Bear he says is Cynosura, the Second Creation, the
small, the narrow way and not Helica. For she leads not
backwards, but guides those who follow her forwards to the
straight way, being the (tail) of the dog. For the Logos is
the Dog (Cyon) who at the same time guards and protects
the sheep against the plans of the wolves, and also chases
the wild beasts from creation and slays them, and who
begets all things. For Cyon, they say, indeed means the
begetter.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Hence, they say, Aratus, speaking of the rising
of Canis, says thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But when the Dog rises, no longer do the crops play false.”&mdash;</div>

<p>This is what he means: Plants that have been planted
in the earth up to the rising of the Dog-star take no root,
but yet grow leaves and appear to beholders as if they will
bear fruit and are alive, but have no life from the root in
them. But when the rising of the Dog-star occurs, the
living plants are distinguished by Canis from the dead, for

he withers entirely those which have not taken root. This
Cyon, he says then, being a certain Divine Logos has been
established judge of quick and dead, and as Cyon is seen
to be the star of the plants, so the Logos, he says, is for the
heavenly plants, that is for men. For some such cause as
this, then, the Second Creation Cynosura stands in heaven
as the image of the rational<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> creature. But between the
two creations Draco is extended below, hindering the things
of the great creation from coming to the lesser, and watching
those things which are fixed in the great creation like the
Kneeler lest they see how and in what way every one is
fixed in the little creation. But Draco is himself watched
as to the head, he says, by Ophiuchus. The same, he says,
is fixed as an image in heaven, being a certain philosophy
for those who can see.</p>

<p>But if this is not clear, through another image, he says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
creation teaches us to philosophize, about which Aratus
speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 129.</span>But near Draco, he says, are Cepheus and Cassiopeia and
Andromeda and Perseus, great letters of<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> the creation to

Cassiopeia Eve, Andromeda the soul of both, Perseus the
winged offspring of Zeus and Cetus the plotting Beast.
Not to any other of these comes Perseus the slayer of the
Beast, but to Andromeda alone. From which Beast, he
says, the Logos Perseus, taking her to himself, delivers
Andromeda who had been given in chains to the Beast.
But Perseus is the winged axis which extends to both poles

the Divine Spirit, because only when it is near the limits of
life, its nature is to sing, and, as one escaping with good hope

But crabs and bulls and lions and rams and goats and kids

<span class="sidenote">p. 130.</span>

and all the other animals who are named in heaven on
account of the stars are, he says, images and paradigms
whence the changeable nature receives the patterns<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and
becomes full of such animals.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Making use of these discourses, they think to deceive as

like them are dancing and not truth. For the stars do not
reveal these things; but men on their own account and for
the better distinguishing of certain stars (from the rest) gave
them names so that they might be a mark to them. For
what likeness have the stars strewn about the heaven to a
bear, or a lion, or kids, or a water-carrier, or Cepheus, or
Andromeda, or to the Shades named in Hades&mdash;for many
of these persons and the names of the stars alike came into
existence long after the stars themselves&mdash;so that the

<span class="sidenote">p. 131.</span>

heretics being struck with the wonder should thus labour
by such discourses to establish their own doctrines?<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>Seeing, however, that nearly all heresy has discovered by
the art of arithmetic measures of hebdomads and certain
projections of Æons, each tearing the art to pieces in
different ways and only changing the names,&mdash;but of these
(men) Pythagoras came to be teacher who first transmitted
to the Greeks such numbers from Egypt&mdash;it seems good
not to pass over this, but after briefly pointing it out to
proceed to the demonstration of the objects of our enquiries.
These men were arithmeticians and geometricians to whom
especially it seems Pythagoras first supplied the principles
(of their arts). And they took the first beginnings (of
things), discovered apparently by reason alone, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
numbers which can always proceed to infinity by multiplication
and the figures (produced by it). For the beginning
of geometry, as may be seen, is an indivisible point; but
from that point the generation of the infinite figures from

<span class="sidenote">p. 132.</span>

the point<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> is discovered by the art. For the point when
extended<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> in length becomes after extension a line having
a point as its limit:<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> and a line when extended in breadth
produces a superficies and the limits of the superficies are
lines: and a superficies extended in depth becomes a (solid)
body:<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> and when this solid is in existence, the nature of
the great body is thus wholly founded from the smallest
point. And this is what Simon says thus: “The little
will be great, being as it were a point; but the great will be
boundless,”<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> in imitation of that geometrical point. But
the beginning of arithmetic, which includes by combination
philosophy, is<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> a number which is boundless and incomprehensible,
containing within itself all the numbers capable of
coming to infinity by multitude. But the beginning of the
numbers becomes by hypostasis the first monad, which is a
male unit begetting as does a father all the other numbers.
Second comes the dyad, a female number, and the same is
called even by the arithmeticians. Third comes the triad,
a male number; this also has been ordained to be called
odd by the arithmeticians. After all these comes the tetrad,

<span class="sidenote">p. 133.</span>

a female number, and this same is also called even, because
it is female. Therefore all the numbers taken from the
genus are four&mdash;but the boundless genus is number&mdash;wherefrom
is constructed their perfect number, the decad. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
1, 2, 3, 4 become 10, as has before been shown, if the
name which is proper to each of the numbers be substantially
kept. This is the sacred Tetractys according to Pythagoras
which contains within itself the roots of eternal nature,
that is, all the other numbers. For the 11, 12 and the rest
take the principle of birth from the 10. Of this decad, the
perfect number, the four parts are called: number, monad,
square and cube. The conjunctions and minglings of which
are for the birth of increase, they completing naturally the
fruitful number. For when this square is multiplied into
itself, it becomes a square squared; but when a square into
a cube, it becomes a square cubed; but when a cube into
a cube, it becomes a cube cubed. So that all the numbers
are seven, in order that the birth of the existing numbers

<span class="sidenote">p. 134.</span>

may come from a hebdomad, which is number, monad,
square, cube, square of a square, cube of a square, cube of
a cube.</p>

<p>Of this hebdomad Simon and Valentinus, having altered
the names, recount prodigies, hastening to base upon it their
own systems.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> For Simon calls (it) thus: Mind, Thought,
Name, Voice, Reasoning, Desire and He who has Stood,
Stands and will Stand: and Valentinus: Mind, Truth,
Word, Life, Man, Church and the Father who is counted
with them. According to these (ideas) of those trained
in the arithmetic philosophy, which they admired as
something unknowable by the crowd, and in pursuance of
them, they constructed the heresies excogitated by them.</p>

<p>Now there are some also who try to construct hebdomads
from the healing art, being struck by the dissection of the
brain, saying that the substance, power of paternity, and
divinity of the universe can be learned from its constitution.

<span class="sidenote">p. 135.</span>

For the brain, being the ruling part of the whole body rests
calm and unmoved, containing within itself the breath.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Now such a story is not incredible, but a long way from their
attempted theory. For the brain when dissected has within
it what is called the chamber, on each side of which are the
membranes which they call wings, gently moved by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
breath, and again driving the breath into the cerebellum.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
And the breath, passing through a certain reed-like vein,
travels to the pineal gland.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Near this lies the mouth of
the cerebellum which receives the breath passing through
and gives it up to the so-called spinal marrow.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> From this
the whole body gets a share of pneumatic (force), all the
arteries being dependent like branches on this vein, the
extremity of which finishes in the genital veins. Whence
also the seeds proceeding from the brain through the loins
are secreted. But the shape of the cerebellum is like the
head of a dragon; concerning which there is much talk
among those of the Gnosis falsely so called, as we have
shown. But there are other six pairs (of vessels) growing
from the brain, which making their way round the head and
finishing within it, connect the bodies together. But the

<span class="sidenote">p. 136.</span>

seventh (goes) from the cerebellum to the lower parts of the
rest of the body, as we have said.</p>

<p>And about this there is much talk since Simon and
Valentinus have found in it hints which they have taken,
although they do not admit it, being first cheats and then
heretics. Since then it seems that we have sufficiently set
out these things, and that all the apparent dogmas of earthly
philosophy have been included in (these) four books,<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> it
seems fitting to proceed to their disciples or rather to their
plagiarists.</p>

<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_257" href="#FNanchor_257" class="label">[1]</a> This is the beginning of the Mt. Athos MS., the first pages having
disappeared. With regard to the first chapter περὶ ἀστρολόγων,
Cruice, following therein Miller, points out that nearly the whole of it
has been taken from Book V with the same title of Sextus Empiricus’
work, Πρὸς Μαθηματικούς, and also that the copying is so faulty that to
make sense it is necessary to restore the text in many places from that
of Sextus. Sextus’ book begins, as did doubtless that of Hippolytus,
with a description of the divisions of the zodiac, the cardinal points
(Ascendant, Mid-heaven, Descendant, and Anti-Meridian), the cadent
and succeedent houses, the use of the clepsydra or water-clock, the
planets and their “dignities,” “exaltations” and “falls,” and finally,
their “terms,” with a description of which our text begins. It is,
perhaps, a pity that Miller did not restore the whole of the missing
part from Sextus Empiricus; but the last-named author is not very
clear, and the reader who wishes to go further into the matter and to
acquire some knowledge of astrological jargon is recommended to
consult also James Wilson’s <i>Complete Dictionary of Astrology</i>, reprinted
at Boston, U.S.A., in 1885, or, if he prefers a more learned work,
M. Bouché-Leclercq’s <i>L’Astrologie Grecque</i>, Paris, 1899. But it may
be said here that the astrologers of the early centuries made their predictions
from a “theme,” or geniture, which was in effect a map of the
heavens at the moment of birth, and showed the ecliptic or sun’s path
through the zodiacal signs divided into twelve “houses,” to each of
which a certain significance was attached. The foundation of this was
the horoscope or sign rising above the horizon at the birth, from which
they were able to calculate the other three cardinal points given above,
the cadent houses being those four which go just before the cardinal
points and the four succeedents those which follow after them. The
places of the planets, including in that term the sun and moon, in
the ecliptic were then calculated and their symbols placed in the houses
indicated. From this figure the judgment or prediction was made, but
a great mass of absurd and contradictory tradition existed as to the
influence of the planets on the life, fortune, and disposition of the
native, which was supposed to depend largely on their places in the
theme both in relation to the earth and to each other.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_258" href="#FNanchor_258" class="label">[2]</a> Bouché-Leclercq, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 206, rightly defines these terms as
fractions of signs separated by internal boundaries and distributed in
each sign among the five planets. Cf. J. Firmicus Maternus, <i>Matheseos</i>,
II, 6, and Cicero, <i>De Divinatione</i>, 40. Wilson, <i>op. cit</i>., s.h.v., says
they are certain degrees in a sign, supposed to possess the power of
altering the nature of a planet to that of the planet in the term of which
it is posited. All the authors quoted say that the astrologers could
not agree upon the extent or position of the various “terms,” and that
in particular the “Chaldæans” and the “Egyptians” were hopelessly
at variance upon the point.</p>

leads from without all that are within them, along the general movement
from East to West. But the latter, belonging to the Different,
lead from within the parts that are carried along from West to East,
and are self-moved, and they are whirled round and along, as it may
happen, by the movement of the Same which possesses in the Cosmos

Archimedes are wrong and that the Platonic theory&mdash;said, one does not
know with what truth, to have been inherited from Pythagoras, viz.,
that the intervals between the orbits of the different bodies of the cosmos
are arranged like the notes on a musical scale&mdash;is to be preferred.
This was perhaps to be expected from a Churchman as favouring the
doctrine of creation by design. It is difficult at first sight to see how
the figures in the text bear out Hippolytus’ contention, inasmuch as the
distances here given of the seven planets (including therein the Sun and
Moon) from the Earth proceed in an irregular kind of arithmetical progression
ranging from one to fifty-four, the distance from the Earth to the
Moon which Hippolytus accepts from Archimedes as correct being taken
as unity. Thus, let us call this unit of distance <i>x</i>, and we have the table

<p>This agrees almost entirely with the theory which M. Bigourdan in
the work mentioned in the last note has worked out as the Platonic theory
of the distances of the different planets from the Earth, “the supposed
centre of their movements” (p. 228). Thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">which distances are, in his own words, “les termes enchevêtrés de deux
progressions géométriques ayant respectivement pour raison 2 et 3,
savoir 1, 2, 4, 8&mdash;1, 3, 9, 27; on voit que l’unité est, comme chez Pythagore,
la distance de la Terre à la Lune.” This conclusion is amply borne
out by Hippolytus’ figures, which, as given in Table II above, show
a regular progression from 2 and 3 to 2<sup>2</sup> and 3<sup>2</sup>, then to 2<sup>3</sup> and 3<sup>3</sup>,
which explains what our author means by increasing the Earth to the
Moon distance, κατὰ τὰ διπλάσιον καὶ τριπλάσιον. The only discrepancy
between this and M. Bigourdan’s table is that he has transposed the
distances between ☿&mdash;♂ and ♂&mdash;♄ respectively; but as I do not know
the details of the calculation on which he bases his figures, I am unable
to say whether the mistake is his or Hippolytus’.</p>

of Claudius Ptolemy, the author of the <i>Almagest</i>? He has certainly
not been mentioned before, but his fame was so great that Hippolytus

audience. Ptolemy lived, perhaps, into the last quarter of the second
century.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_458" href="#FNanchor_458" class="label">[202]</a> In this chapter Hippolytus for the first time sets himself seriously
to prove the thesis which he has before asserted, <i>i. e.</i>, that all the Gnostic
systems are derived from the teachings of the Greek philosophers. His
mode of doing so is to compare the elaborate systems of Aeons or
emanations of deity imagined by heresiarchs like Simon Magus and
Valentinus to the views attributed by him to Pythagoras which make all
nature to spring from one indivisible point. Whether Pythagoras ever
held such views may be doubted and we have no means of checking
Hippolytus’ always loose statements on this point; but something like
them appears in the <i>Theaetetus</i> of Plato where arithmetic and geometry
seem to be connected by talk about oblong as well as square numbers
and the construction of solids from them. If we imagine with the
Greeks (see n. on p. <a href="#Page_37">37</a> <i>supra</i>) that numbers are not abstract things,
but actual portions of space, there is indeed a strong likeness between
the ideas of the later Platonists as to the construction of the world by
means of numbers and those attributed to the Gnostic teachers as to its
emanation from God. Whether these last really held the views thus
attributed to them is another matter. Cf. <i>Forerunners</i>, II, pp. 99, 100.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="sidenote">p. 137.</span>1. <span class="smcap">These</span> are the contents of the 5th (book) of the
Refutation of all Heresies.</p>

<p>2. What the Naassenes say who call themselves Gnostics,
and that they profess those opinions which the philosophers

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 138.</span>6. I consider that the tenets concerning the Divine and the
fashioning of the cosmos (held by) all those who are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
deemed philosophers by Greeks and Barbarians have been
very painfully set forth in the four books before this. Whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
curious arts I have not neglected, so that I have undertaken
for the readers no chance labour, exhorting many to
love of learning and certainty of knowledge about the truth.
Now therefore there remains to hasten on to the refutation
of the heresies, with which intent<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> also we have set forth
the things aforesaid. From which philosophers the
heresiarchs have taken hints in common<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and patching
like cobblers the mistakes of the ancients on to their
own thoughts, have offered them as new to those they
can deceive, as we shall prove in (the books) which follow.
For the rest, it is time to approach the subjects laid down
before, but to begin with those who have dared to sing the
praises of the Serpent, who is in fact the cause of the error,
through certain systems invented by his action. Therefore

<span class="sidenote">p. 139.</span>

the priests and chiefs of the doctrine were the first who
were called Naassenes, being thus named in the Hebrew
tongue: for the Serpent is called Naas.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Afterwards they
called themselves Gnostics alleging that they alone knew the
depths.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Separating themselves from which persons, many
men have made the heresy, which is really one, a much
divided affair, describing the same things according to varying
opinions, as this discourse will argue as it proceeds.</p>

<p>These men worship as the beginning of all things,
according to their own statement, a Man and a Son of Man.
But this Man is masculo-feminine<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and is called by them
Adamas;<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and hymns to him are many and various. And

<span class="sidenote">p. 140.</span>

the hymns, to cut it short, are repeated by them somehow
like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>“From thee a father, and through thee a mother, the
two deathless names, parents of Aeons, O thou citizen of
heaven, Man of great name!”<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>But they divide him like Geryon into three parts. For
there is of him, they say, the intellectual (part), the psychic
and the earthly; and they consider that the knowledge of
him is the beginning of the capacity to know God, speaking
thus: “The beginning of perfection is the knowledge of
man, but the knowledge of God is completed perfection.”
But all these things, he says, the intellectual, and the
psychic and the earthly, proceeded and came down together
into one man, Jesus who was born of Mary;<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and there
spoke together, he says, in the same way, these three men
each of them from his own substance to his own. For
there are three kinds of universals<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> according to them (to
wit) the angelic,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the psychic and the earthly; and three
churches, the angelic, the psychic and the earthly; but their
names are: Chosen, Called, Captive.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 141.</span>7. These are the heads of the very many discourses which
they say James the brother of the Lord handed down to
Mariamne.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> So then, that the impious may no longer
speak falsely either of Mariamne, or of James, or of his
Saviour, we will come to the Mysteries, whence comes their
fable, both the Barbarian and the Greek, and we shall see
how these men collecting together the hidden and ineffable
mysteries of the nations<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and speaking falsely of Christ,
lead astray those who have not seen the Gentiles’ secret rites.
For since the Man Adamas is their foundation, and they
say there has been written of him “Who shall declare his

<span class="sidenote">p. 142.</span>

generation?”<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> learn ye how, taking from the nations in turn
the undiscoverable and distinguished<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> generation of the
Man, they apply this to Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>“For earth, say the Greeks, was the first to give
forth man, thus bearing a goodly gift. For she wished
to be the mother not of plants without feeling and wild
beasts without sense, but of a gentle and God-loving
animal. But hard it is, he says, to discover whether
Alalcomeneus of the Boeotians came forth upon the

<span class="sidenote">p. 143.</span>

Cephisian shore as the first of men, or whether (the
first men) were the Idæan Curetes, a divine race, or
the Phrygian Corybantes whom the Sun saw first
shooting up like trees, or whether Arcadia brought
forth Pelasgus earlier than the Moon, or Eleusis
Diaulus dweller in the Rarian field, or Lemnos gave
birth to Cabirus, fair child of ineffable orgies, or Pallene
to Alcyon, eldest of the Giants. But the Libyans say
Iarbas the first-born crept forth from the parched field
to pluck Zeus’ sweet acorn. So also, he says that the
Nile of the Egyptians, making fat the mud which unto
this day begets life, gave forth living bodies made flesh
with moist heat.”<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p>But the Assyrians say that fish-eating<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Oannes (the first
man) was born among them and the Chaldæans (say the
same thing about) Adam; and they assert that he was the
man whom the earth brought forth alone, and that he lay
breathless, motionless (and) unmoved like unto a statue
being the image of him on high who is praised in song as
the man Adamas; but that he was produced by many

<span class="sidenote">p. 144.</span>

powers about whom in turn there is much talk.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>In order then that the Great Man<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> on high, from whom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
as they say, “every fatherhood<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> named on earth and in the
heavens” is framed, might be completely held fast, there
was given to him also a soul, so that through the soul he
might suffer, and that the enslaved “image of the great and
most beautiful and Perfect Man”&mdash;for thus they call him&mdash;might
be punished.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Wherefore again they ask what is the
soul and of what kind is its nature that coming to the man
and moving<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> him it should enslave and punish the image of
the Perfect Man. But they ask this, not from the Scriptures,
but from the mystic rites. And they say that the soul is
very hard to find and to comprehend, since it does not stay
in the same shape or form, nor is it always in one and the
same state, so that one might describe it by a type or
comprehend it in substance.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But these various changes
of the soul they hold to be set down in the Gospel inscribed
to the Egyptians.</p>

<p>They doubt then, as do all other men of the nations,
whether the soul is from the pre-existent, or from the self-begotten,

<span class="sidenote">p. 145.</span>

or from the poured-forth Chaos.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And first
they betake themselves to the mysteries of the Assyrians<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
to understand the triple division of the Man; for the
Assyrians were the first to think the soul tripartite and yet
one. For every nature, they say, longs for the soul, but
each in a different way. For soul is the cause of all things
that are, and all things which are nourished and increase,
he says, require soul. For nothing like nurture or increase,
he says, can occur unless soul be present. And even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
stones, he says, are animated,<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> for they have the power of
increase, and no increase can come without nourishment.
For by addition increase the things which increase and the
addition is the nourishment of that which is nourished.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
Therefore every nature he says, of things in heaven, and on
earth, and below the earth, longs for a soul. But the Assyrians
call such a thing<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Adonis or Endymion or (Attis); and
when it is invoked as Adonis Aphrodite loves and longs after
the soul of such name. And Aphrodite is generation<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> according
to them. But when Persephone or Core loves Adonis<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
there is a certain mortal soul separated from Aphrodite

<span class="sidenote">p. 146.</span>

(that is from generation).<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And if Selene should come
to desire of Endymion<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and to love of his beauty, the
nature of the sublime ones, he says, also requires soul.
But if, he says, the Mother of the Gods castrate Attis,<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and she holds this loved one, the blessed nature of the
hypercosmic and eternal ones on high recalls to her, he
says, the masculine power of the soul.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> For, says he, the
Man is masculo-feminine. According to this argument of
theirs, then, the so-called<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> intercourse of woman with man
is by (the teaching of) their school shown to be an utterly
wicked and defiling thing. For Attis is castrated, he says,
that is, he has changed over from the earthly parts of the
lower creation to the eternal substance on high, where, he
says, there is neither male nor female,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but a new creature,<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
a new Man, who is masculo-feminine. What they mean by
“on high” I will show in its appropriate place when I
come to it. But they say it bears witness to what they say
that Rhea is not simply one (goddess) but, so to speak, the

<span class="sidenote">p. 147.</span>

whole creature.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> And this they say is made quite clear by
the saying:&mdash;“For the invisible things of Him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made by Him, in truth, His eternal
power and godhead, so that they are without excuse.
Since when they knew Him as God, they glorified Him
not as God, neither were thankful, but foolishness deceived
their hearts. For thinking themselves wise, they became
fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into
the likenesses of an image of corruptible man and of birds
and of fourfooted and creeping things. Wherefore God
gave them up to passions of dishonour. For even their
women changed their natural use to that which is against
nature.”<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> And what the natural use is according to them,
we shall see later. “Likewise, also the males leaving the
natural use of the female burned in their lust one toward
another males among males working unseemliness.”<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But
unseemliness is according to them the first and blessed and
unformed substance which is the cause of all the forms of

<span class="sidenote">p. 148.</span>

things which are formed. “And receiving in themselves the
recompense of their error which is meet.”<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> For in these
words, which Paul has spoken, they say is comprised their
whole secret and the ineffable mystery of the blessed
pleasure. For the promise of baptism<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> is not anything else
according to them than the leading to unfading pleasure
him who is baptized according to them in living water and
anointed with silent<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> ointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>And they say that not only do the mysteries of the
Assyrians bear witness to their saying, but also those of the
Phrygians concerning the blessed nature, hitherto hidden
and yet at the same time displayed, of those who were and
are and shall be, which, he says, is the kingdom of the
heavens sought for within man.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Concerning which
nature they have explicitly made tradition in the Gospel
inscribed according to Thomas,<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> saying thus: “Whoso
seeks me shall find me in children from seven years (upwards).
For there in the fourteenth year I who am hidden

<span class="sidenote">p. 149.</span>

am made manifest.” This, however, is the saying not of
Christ but of Hippocrates, who says: “At seven years old,
a boy is half a father.” Whence they who place the
primordial nature of the universals in the primordial seed
having heard the Hippocratian (adage) that a boy of seven
years old is half a father, say that in fourteen years according
to Thomas it will be manifest. This is their ineffable and
mystical saying.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>They say then that the Egyptians, who are admitted to be
the most ancient of all men after the Phrygians and the
first at once to impart to all men the initiations and secret
rites<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> of the gods, and to have proclaimed forms and
activities, have the holy and august and for those who are
not initiated unutterable mysteries of Isis. And these are
nothing else than the <i>pudendum</i> of Osiris which was snatched
away and sought for by her of the seven stoles and black

<span class="sidenote">p. 150.</span>

garments.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> But they say Osiris is water. And the seven-stoled
nature which has about it and is equipped with
seven ethereal stoles&mdash;for thus they allegorically call the
wandering stars&mdash;is like mutable generation<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and shows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
that the creation is transformed by the Ineffable and Unportrayable<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
and Incomprehensible and Formless One.
And this is what is said in the Scripture: “The just shall
fall seven times and rise again.”<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> For these falls, he says,
are the turnings about of the stars when moved by him
who moves all things. They say, then, about the substance
of the seed which is the cause of all things that are, that it
belongs to none of these but begets and creates all things
that are, speaking thus: “I become what I wish, and I am
what I am; wherefore I say that it is the immoveable that
moves all things. For it remains what it is, creating all
things and nothing comes into being from begotten things.”<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
He says that this alone is good and that it is of this that the
Saviour spoke when he said: “Why callest thou me good?
There is one good, my Father who is in the heavens, Who
makes the sun to rise upon the just and the unjust, and

<span class="sidenote">p. 151.</span>

rains upon the holy and the sinners.”<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> And who are the
holy upon whom He rains and who the sinful we shall see
with other things later on. And this is the great secret and
the unknowable mystery concealed and revealed by the
Egyptians. For Osiris, he says, is in the temple in front
of Isis, whose <i>pudendum</i> stands exposed looking upwards
from below, and wearing as a crown all its fruits of begotten
things.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And they say not only does such a thing stand in
the most holy temples, but is made known to all like a light
not set under a bushel but placed on a candlestick making

<span class="sidenote">p. 152.</span>

its announcement on the housetops in all the streets and
highways and near all dwellings being set before them as
some limit and term.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> For they call this the bringer of
luck, not knowing what they say.</p>

<p>And this mystery the Greeks who have taken it over from
the Egyptians keep unto this day. For we see, he says,
the (images) of Hermes in such a form honoured among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
them. And they say that they especially honour Cyllenius
the Eloquent. For Hermes is the Word who, being the
interpreter and fashioner<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> of what has been, is, and will be,
stands honoured among them carved into some such form
which is the <i>pudendum</i> of a man straining from the things
below to those on high. And that this&mdash;that is, such a
Hermes&mdash;is, he says, a leader of souls and a sender forth of
them, and a cause of souls, did not escape the poets of the
nations who speak thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">This he says is Ocean, “source of gods and source of
men”<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> ever ebbing and flowing now forth and now back.
But when he says Ocean flows forth there is birth of men,
but when back to the wall and stockade and the Leucadian
rock there is birth of gods. This he says is that which is
written: “I have said ye are all gods and sons of the
Highest; if you hasten to flee from Egypt and win across the
Red Sea into the desert,” that is from the mixture below to
the Jerusalem above who is the Mother of (all) living. “But
if ye return again to Egypt,” that is to the mixture below,

<span class="sidenote">p. 157.</span>

“ye shall die as men.”<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> For deathly, says he, is all birth
below, but deathless that which is born above; for it is
born of water alone and the spirit, spiritual not fleshly. This,
he says, is that which is written: “That which is born of
the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is
spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> This is, according to them, the spiritual birth.
This, he says, is the great Jordan which flowing forth prevented
the sons of Israel from coming out of the land of
Egypt&mdash;or rather, from the mixture below; for Egypt is the
body according to them&mdash;until Joshua<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> turned it and made

imagine that their own prophet Homer unspeakably<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> foreshowed<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
these things and they mock at those who not
being initiated in the Holy Scriptures are led together into
such designs. But they say: whoso says all things were
framed from one, errs; but whoso says from three speaks
the truth and gives an exposition of (the things of) the
universe. For one, he says, is the blessed nature of the
Blessed Man above, Adamas, and one is the mortal (nature),

<span class="sidenote">p. 158.</span>

below, and one is the kingless race begotten on high, where,
he says, is Mariam the sought-for one, and Jothor the great
wise one, and Sephora the seer,<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and Moses whose generation
was not in Egypt&mdash;for there were children born to him
in Midian&mdash;and this, he says, was not forgotten by the
poets:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">For sublime things, he says, must needs be spoken, but
they are spoken everywhere, lest “hearing they should not
hear and seeing they should see not.”<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> For if, he says, the
sublime things were not spoken, the cosmos could not have
been framed. These are the three ponderous words:
Caulacau, Saulasau, Zeesar.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Caulacau the one on high,

<span class="sidenote">p. 159.</span>

Adamas, Saulasau, the mortal nature below, Zeesar the
Jordan which flows back on its source. This is, he says,
the masculo-feminine Man who is in all things, whom the
ignorant call the triple-bodied Geryon&mdash;as if Geryon were
“flowing from Earth”<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>&mdash;and the Greeks usually “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
heavenly horn of Mên”<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> because he has mingled and compounded
all things with all. “For all things, he says, were
made through him and apart from him not one thing was
made. That which was in him is life.”<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This, he says is
the life, the unspeakable family of perfect men which
was not known to the former generation. But the “nothing”
which came into being apart from him is the world
of form; for it came without him by the 3rd and 4th.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
This, he says, is the cup Condy in which the king drinking,
divineth. This, he says, is that which was hidden among
the fair grains of Benjamin. And the Greeks also say the
same with raving lips:&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was enough, he says, that only this should be known to
men that Anacreon’s cup spoke mutely an unspeakable
mystery. For mute, he says, was Anacreon’s cup which
says Anacreon, tells him with mute speech what he must
become, that is spiritual not fleshly, if he hears the hidden
mystery in silence. And this is the water in those fair
nuptials which Jesus changed by making wine. This, he
says, is the mighty and true beginning of the signs which
Jesus did in Cana in Galilee and made known the kingdom
of the heavens. This, he says, is the kingdom of the heavens
within us, as a treasure as the leaven hidden within three
measures of meal.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 161.</span>This is, he says, the great and unspeakable mystery of
the Samothracians which is allowed to be known to us alone
who are perfect. For the Samothracians explicitly hand
down in the mysteries celebrated by them that Adam is the
Arch-man. And in the temple of the Samothracians stand
two statues of naked men having both hands stretched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
forth to heaven and their <i>pudenda</i> turned upwards like
that of Hermes on (Mt.) Cyllene. But the aforesaid
statues are the images of the Arch-man and of the re-born
spiritual one in all things of one substance<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> with that man.
This, he says, is what was spoken by the Saviour: “Unless
ye drink my blood and eat my flesh, ye shall not enter
into the kingdom of the heavens; but even though, He says,
ye drink the cup which I drink when I go forth you will
not be able to enter there.”<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> For He knew, he says, from
which nature each of His disciples was, and that each of
them was compelled to come to his own special nature.
For from the twelve tribes, he says, He chose twelve

<span class="sidenote">p. 162.</span>

disciples,<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and by them He spake to every tribe. Whence,
he says, all could not have heard the preachings of the
twelve disciples, nor, had they heard them could they have
been received. For the things which are not according to<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
nature are with them natural.</p>

<p>This, he says, the Thracians who dwell about Mt.
Hæmus and like them the Phrygians call Corybas,<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> because
although he takes the beginning of his descent from the
head on high and from the Unportrayable one and
passes through all the sources of underlying things, we
know not how and in what fashion he comes. This, he
says, is the saying: “We have heard his voice, but we
have not seen his shape.”<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> For, he says, the voice of him
who is set apart and has been impressed with the image<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> is
heard, but no one has seen what is the shape which has
come down from on high from the Unportrayable One.
But it is in the earthly form and no one is aware of it. This,
he says, is the God who dwells in the flood according to
the Psalter and “who speaks aloud and cries from many
waters.”<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> “Many waters,” he says, is the manifold
generation of mortal men, wherefrom he shouts and cries

<span class="sidenote">p. 163.</span>

aloud to the Unportrayable Man: “Deliver my only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
begotten from the lions!”<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In answer to this, he says, is
the saying: “Thou art my son, O Israel. Fear not. If
thou passest through the rivers they shall not overwhelm
thee; if through the fire, it shall not burn thee.”<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> By
rivers is meant, he says, the moist essence of generation,
and by fire the rage and desire for generation. “Thou art
mine. Be not afraid.” And again he speaks: “If a
mother forget her children and pities them not nor gives
them suck, yet will I not forget thee.”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Adamas, he says,
speaks to his own men: “But although a woman shall forget
these things, yet will I not forget you. I have graven you
on my hands.”<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> But concerning his ascension, that is,
the being born again, that he may be born spiritual, not
fleshly, he says, the Scripture speaks: “Lift up the gates,
ye rulers, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors, and the

<span class="sidenote">p. 164.</span>

King of Glory shall enter in.”<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> That is the wonder of
wonders. “For who,” he says, “is this King of Glory? A
worm and not a man, a reproach of man and an object of
contempt for the people. This is the King of Glory, he who
is mighty in battle.”<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> But he means the war which is
in the body, because the (outward) form is made from
warring elements, he says, as it is written: “Remember
the war which is in the body.”<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> The same entrance and
the same gate, he says, Jacob saw when journeying to
Mesopotamia&mdash;for Mesopotamia, he says, is the flow of the
great Ocean flowing forth from the middle part<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> of the
Perfect Man&mdash;and he wondered at the heavenly gate,
saying: “How terrible is this place! It is none other
than the house of God, and this is the gate of Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Wherefore, he says, the saying of Jesus: “I am the true
gate.”<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Now He who says this is, he says, the Perfect

<span class="sidenote">p. 165.</span>

Man who has been impressed above (with the image) of
the Unportrayable one. Therefore he says, the perfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
man will not be saved unless born again by entering in
through this gate.</p>

<p>But this same one, he says, the Phrygians<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> call also
Papas, because he set at rest that which had been moved
irregularly and discordantly before his coming. For the
name of Papa, he says, is (taken from) all things in heaven,
on earth, and below the earth, saying: “Make to cease!
make to cease!<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> the discord of the cosmos and make peace
for those that are afar off,”<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> that is, for the material and
earthly, and also “for those that are anigh,” that is, for the
spiritual and understanding perfect men. But the Phrygians
say that the same one is also a “corpse,” having been buried
in the body as in a monument or tomb.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> This, he says, is
the saying: “Ye are whited sepulchres filled within with
dead men’s bones,”<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> that is, there is not within you the
living Man. And again, he says, “the dead shall leap forth
from their graves,”<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that is, the spiritual man, not the
fleshly, shall be born again from the bodies of the earthly.
This, he says, is the resurrection which comes through the

<span class="sidenote">p. 166.</span>

gate of the heavens, through which if they do not enter, all
remain dead. And the same Phrygians, he says again, say
that this same one is by reason of the change a god. For
he becomes God when he arises from the dead and enters
into heaven through the same gate. This gate, he says,
Paul the Apostle knew, having set it ajar in mystery and
declaring that he “was caught up by an angel and came
unto a second and third heaven into Paradise itself and
beheld what he beheld, and heard ineffable words which it
is not lawful for man to utter.”<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> These are, he says, the
mysteries called ineffable by all “which (we also speak) not
in the words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught
by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual; but
the natural<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of
God, for they are foolishness unto him”;<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and these, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
says, are the ineffable mysteries of the Spirit which we alone
behold. Concerning them, he says, the Saviour spake:
“No man shall come unto me unless my heavenly Father
draw some one (unto me).”<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> For very hard it is, he says,
to receive and take this great and ineffable mystery. And

<span class="sidenote">p. 167.</span>

again, he says, the Saviour spake: “Not every one who
sayeth unto me, Lord! Lord! shall enter into the kingdom
of the heavens, but he who doeth the will of my Father who
is in the heavens.”<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Of which (will) he says, they must
be doers and not hearers only to enter into the kingdom
of the heavens. And again, says he, He spake: “The
publicans and the harlots go before you into the kingdom
of the heavens.”<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> For the publicans, he says, are those
who receive the taxes of market-wares, and we are the tax-gatherers
“upon whom the ends of the æons have come
down.”<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> For the “ends,” he says, are the seeds sown in
the cosmos by the Unportrayable One,<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> whereby the whole
cosmos is completed;<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> for by them also it began to be.
And this, he says, is the saying: “The sower went forth to
sow, and some (seed) fell on the wayside and was trodden
under foot, and some upon stony (parts) and sprang up; and
because it had no root, he says, it withered and died. But some
fell, he says, upon the fair and goodly earth and brought
forth some a hundredfold, and some sixty and some thirty.

<span class="sidenote">p. 168.</span>

He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> This is, he says,
that no one becomes a hearer of these mysteries save only
the perfect Gnostics. This, he says, is the fair and goodly
earth of which Moses spake: “I will bring you to a fair
and goodly land, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
This, he says, is the honey and the milk, tasting which the
perfect become kingless and partakers of the fulness.<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The
same, he says, is the Pleroma, whereby all things that are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
begotten by the unbegotten have come into being and
are filled.</p>

<p>But the same one is called by the Phrygians “unfruitful.”
For he is unfruitful when he is fleshly and performs the
desire of the flesh. This, he says, is the saying: “Every
tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is cut down and
cast into the fire.”<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> For these fruits, he says, are only the
rational, the living man who enter by the third gate.<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> They
say, indeed: “Ye who eat dead things and make living
ones, what will ye make if ye eat living things?”<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> For
they say that words<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and thoughts and men are living
things cast down by that Unportrayable One into the form

<span class="sidenote">p. 169.</span>

below. This, he says, is what he means: “Throw not
your holy things to the dogs nor pearls to the swine,”<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
saying that the intercourse of woman with man is the work
of dogs and swine.</p>

<p>But this same one, he says, the Phrygians call goatherd,
not because, he says, he feeds goats and he-goats, as the
psychic man calls them, but because, he says, he is Aipolos,
that is, he who is ever revolving<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and turning about and
driving the whole cosmos in its circumvolution. For to
revolve is to turn about and to change the position of
things, whence, he says, the two centres of the heaven men
call Poles. And the poet says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What unerring ancient of the sea turns hither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Immortal Egyptian Proteus.”&mdash;</div>
    <div class="right">(<i>Odyssey</i>, IV, 384.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">He<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> is not betrayed (by Eidothea), he says, but turns
himself about, as it were, and goes to and fro. He says,
too, that cities wherein we dwell are called πόλεις, because

<span class="sidenote">p. 170.</span>

we turn and go about in them. Thus, he says, the
Phrygians call him Aipolos, who turns everything always
in every direction and changes it into what it should be.
But the Phrygians also call the same one “of many fruits,”
because (the Naassene writer) says, “the children of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
desolate are more in number than those of her who has
a husband”;<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> that is, the deathless things which are born
again and ever remain are many, if few are those which are
born (once); but all the things of the flesh, he says, are
corruptible, even if those which are born are many. Wherefore,
he says, Rachel mourned for her children and would
not be comforted when mourning over them, for she knew,
he says, that they were not.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> And Jeremiah wails for the
Jerusalem below, not the city in Phœnicia,<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> but the mortal
generation below. For Jeremiah, he says, also knew the
Perfect Man who has been born again of water and the
spirit and is not fleshly. The same Jeremiah indeed said:
“He is a man, and who shall know him?”<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Thus, he says,
the knowledge of the Perfect Man is very deep and hard to
comprehend. For the beginning of perfection, he says, is
the knowledge of man; but the knowledge of God is completed
perfection.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 171.</span>The Phrygians also say, however, that he is a “green
ear of corn reaped”; and following the Phrygians, the
Athenians when initiating (any one) into the Eleusinian
(Mysteries) also show to those who have been made epopts
the mighty and wonderful and most perfect mystery for an
epopt<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> there&mdash;a green ear of corn reaped in silence.<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> And
this ear of corn is also for the Athenians the great and
perfect spark of light from the Unportrayable One; just as
the hierophant himself, not indeed castrated like Attis, but
rendered a eunuch by hemlock, and cut off from all fleshly
generation, celebrating by night at Eleusis the great and
ineffable mysteries beside a huge fire, cries aloud and makes
proclamation, saying: “August Brimo has brought forth a
holy son, Brimos,” that is, the strong (has given birth) to
the strong.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> For august is, he says, the generation which is
spiritual or heavenly or sublime, and strong is that which
is thus generated. For the mystery is called Eleusis or
Anacterion: “Eleusis,” he says, because we spiritual ones

<span class="sidenote">p. 172.</span>

came on high rushing from the Adamas below.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
<i>eleusesthai</i>, he says is to come, but <i>anactoreion</i> the return on
high. This, he says, is what they who have been initiated into
the mysteries of the Eleusinians say. But it is a regulation
that those who have been initiated into the Lesser Mysteries
should moreover be initiated into the Great. For greater
destinies obtain greater portions.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> But the Lesser Mysteries,
he says, are those of Persephone below and of the way
leading thither, which is wide and broad and bears the
dead to Persephone, and the poet says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But under her is a straight and rugged road</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hollow and muddy, but the best to lead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the delightful grove of much-reverenced Aphrodite.”<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These, he says, are the Lesser Mysteries, those of fleshly
generation, after being initiated into which men ought to

<span class="sidenote">p. 173.</span>

cease (from the small) and be initiated into the great and
heavenly ones. For those who have obtained greater
destinies, he says, receive greater portions. For this, he
says, is the gate of heaven and this the house of God where
the good God dwells alone,<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> into which will not enter, he
says, any unpurified, any psychic or fleshly one; but it is
kept for the spiritual only, where those who are must cast
aside<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> their garments and all become bridegrooms, having
come to maturity through the virgin spirit.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> For this is the
virgin who bears in her womb and conceives and gives
birth to a son not psychic or corporeal, but the blessed
Aeon of Aeons. Concerning these things, he says, the
Saviour expressly spake: “Narrow and straitened is the
way that leads to life and few are those who enter into it;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
but wide and broad is the way leading to destruction and
many are they who pass along it.”<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>9. But the Phrygians further say that the Father of the

<span class="sidenote">p. 174.</span>

universals is Amygdalus, not a tree, he says, but that pre-existent
almond<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> which containing within itself the perfect
fruit (and) as if pulsating and stirring in the depth, tore asunder
its breasts and gave birth to its own invisible and unnameable
and ineffable boy of whom we are speaking.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> For “Amyxai”
is as if to burst and cut asunder,<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> as he says, in the case of
inflamed bodies having within them any gathering, the
surgeons who cut them open call them “amychas.” Thus,
he says, the Phrygians call the almond from whom the
invisible one proceeded and was born, and through whom
all things came into being and apart from whom nothing
came into being.</p>

<p>But the Phrygians say that he who was thence born is a
piper, because that which was born is a melodious spirit. For
God, he says, is a Spirit, wherefore neither on this mountain
nor in Jerusalem shall the true worshippers prostrate themselves,
but in spirit.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> For spiritual, he says, is the prostration
of the perfect, not fleshly. But the Spirit, he says, (is)
there where both the Father and the Son are named, being

<span class="sidenote">p. 175.</span>

there born from this (Son and from) the Father.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> This, he
says, is the many-named, myriad-eyed<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> incomprehensible
One for whom every nature yearns, but each in a different
way. This, he says, is the Word<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> of God, which is, he
says, the word of announcement of the great Power.
Wherefore it will be sealed and hidden and concealed,
lying in the habitation wherein the root of the universals<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
is established, that is<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> (the root) of Aeons, Powers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Thoughts, Gods, Angels, Emissary Spirits, things which
are, things which are not, things begotten, things unbegotten,
things incomprehensible, things comprehensible,
years, months, days, hours (and) of an Indivisible Point,<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
from which what is least begins to increase successively.
The Point, he says, being nothing and consisting of nothing
(and) being indivisible will become of itself a certain magnitude
incomprehensible by thought.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> It, he says, is the
kingdom of the heavens, the grain of mustard seed, the
Indivisible Point inherent to the body which none knoweth,
he says, save the spiritual alone. This, he says, is the saying:
“There are no tongues nor speech where their voice is not

<span class="sidenote">p. 176.</span>

heard.”<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Thus they hastily declare that the things which are said
and are done by all men are to be understood in their way,
imagining that all things become spiritual. Whence they
also say that not even they who exhibit (in the) theatres
say or do anything not comprehended in advance.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> So
for example, he says, when the populace have assembled in
the theatres<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> some one makes entrance clad in a notable
robe bearing a cithara and singing to it. Thus he speaks
chanting the Great Mysteries<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> (but) not knowing what he
is saying:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">This, he says, is the many-formed Attis to whom they sing
praises, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will hymn Attis, son of Rhea, not making quiver with a buzzing
sound, nor with the cadence of the Idæan Curetes’ flutes, but I will

<p class="noin">For such and such-like words they frequent the so-called
Mysteries of the great Mother, thinking especially that by
means of what is enacted there, they perceive the whole
mystery. For they get no advantage from what is acted
there except that they are not castrated. They merely
perfect the work of the castrated;<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> for they give most
pointed and careful instructions to abstain as if castrated
from intercourse with women. But the rest of the work as

<span class="sidenote">p. 178.</span>

we have said many times, they perform like the castrated.</p>

<p>But they worship none other than the Naas, calling themselves
Naassenes. But Naas is the serpent, from whom he
says, all temples under heaven are called <i>naos</i> from the
Naas; and that to that Naas alone is dedicated every holy
place and every initiation and every mystery, and generally
that no initiation can be found under heaven in which there
is not a <i>naos</i> and the Naas within it, whence it has come to
be called a <i>naos</i>. But they say that the serpent is the
watery substance, as did Thales of Miletos<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and that no
being, in short, of immortals or mortals, of those with souls
or of those without souls, can be made without him. And
that all things are set under him, and that he is good and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
contains all things within him as in the horn of the one-horned
bull<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> (so as) to contribute beauty and bloom to all
things according to their own nature and kind, as if he had
passed through all “as if he went forth from Edem and cut
himself into four heads.”<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>But this Edem, they say, is the brain, as it were bound

<span class="sidenote">p. 179.</span>

and enlaced in the surrounding coverings as in the heavens;
and they consider man as far as the head alone to be
Paradise. Therefore “the river that came forth from
Eden”&mdash;that is from the brain&mdash;they think “is separated
into four heads and the name of the first river is called
Phison; this it is which encompasses all the land of
Havilat. There is gold and the gold of that land is good,
and there is bdellium and the onyx stone.”<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> This, he says,
(is the) eye, bearing witness by its honour (among the other
features) and its colours to the saying: “But the name of
the second river is Gihon; this it is which encompasses all
the land of Ethiopia.” This, he says, is the hearing, being
somewhat like a labyrinth. “And the name of the third is
Tigris; this it is which goes about over against the Assyrians.”
This, he says, is the smell which makes use of the
swiftest current of the flood. And it goes about over
against the Assyrians because in inspiration the breath drawn
in from the outer air is sharper and stronger than the
respired breath. For this is the nature of respiration.
“The fourth river is Euphrates.” This they say, is the
mouth, which is the seat of prayer and the entrance of food,

<span class="sidenote">p. 180.</span>

which gladdens<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> and nourishes and characterizes<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> the
spiritual perfect man. This, he says, is the water above
the firmament concerning which, he says, the Saviour
spake: “If thou knewest who it is that asks thou would
have asked of him, and he would have given thee to drink
living rushing water.”<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> To this water, he says, comes every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
nature to choose its own substances,<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and from this water
goes forth to every nature that which is proper to it, he
says, more (certainly) than iron to the magnet, gold to the
spine of the sea-falcon and husks to amber.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> But if anyone,
he says, is blind from birth, and has not beheld the
true light which lightens every man who cometh into the
world,<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> let him recover his sight again through us, and
behold how as it were through some Paradise full of all
plants and seeds, the water flows among them. Let him
see, too, that from one and the same water the olive-tree
chooses and draws to itself oil, and the vine wine, and each
of the other plants (that which is) according to its kind.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 181.</span>But that Man, he says, is without honour in the world,
and much honoured [in heaven, being betrayed] by those
who know not to those who know him not, and accounted
like a drop which falleth from a vessel.<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> But we are, he
says, the spiritual who have chosen out of the living water,
the Euphrates flowing through the midst of Babylon, that
which is ours, entering in through the true gate which is

thought it right to add this also. This psalm has been

of diverse shape like the fabled Hydra, we, having struck
off its heads at one blow by refutation, (and) using the rod

<p>12. There is also indeed a certain other (heresy), the
Peratic, the blasphemy of whose (followers) against Christ
has for many years evaded (us). Whose secret mysteries
it now seems fitting for us to bring into the open. They
suppose the cosmos to be one, divided into three parts.
But of this triple division, one part according to them is, as
it were, a single principle like a great source<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> which may be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>

<span class="sidenote">p. 186.</span>

cut by the mind into boundless sections. And the first and
chiefest section according to them is the triad and (the one
part of it)<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> is called Perfect Good and Fatherly Greatness.<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
But the second part of this triad of theirs is, as it were, a
certain boundless multitude of powers which have come
into being from themselves, while the third is (the world of)
form. And the first is unbegotten and is good; and the
second is good (and) self-begotten, while the third is begotten.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
Whence they say expressly that there are three
Gods, three <i>logoi</i>, three minds, and three men. For they
assign to each part of the world of the divided divisibility,
gods and <i>logoi</i> and minds and men and the rest. But they
say that from on high, from the unbegottenness and the first
section of the cosmos, when the cosmos had already been
brought to completion, there came down through causes
which we shall declare later<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> in the days of Herod a certain
triple-bodied and triple-powered<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> man called Christ, containing
within Himself all the compounds<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and powers from

<span class="sidenote">p. 187.</span>

the three parts of the cosmos. And this, he says is the
saying: “The whole Pleroma was pleased to dwell within
Him bodily and the whole godhead” of the Triad thus
divided “is in Him.”<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> For, he says that there were
brought down from the two overlying worlds, (to wit) the
unbegotten and the self-begotten, unto this world in which
we are, seeds of all powers. But what is the manner of
their descent we shall see later.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Then he says that Christ
was brought down from on high from the unbegottenness so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
that through His descent all the threefold divisions should
be saved. For the things, he says, brought down below
shall ascend through Him; but those which take counsel
together against those brought down from above shall be
banished and after they have been punished shall be rooted
out. This, he says, is the saying: “The Son of Man came
not into the world to destroy the world, but that the world
through Him might be saved.”<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> He calls “the world,” he
says, the two overlying portions, (to wit) the unbegotten
and the self-begotten. When the Scripture says: “Lest
ye be judged with the world,”<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> he says, it means the third
part of the cosmos (to wit) that of form. For the third part

<span class="sidenote">p. 188.</span>

which he calls the world must be destroyed, but the two
overlying ones preserved from destruction.<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>13. Let us first learn, then, how they who have taken
this teaching from the astrologers insult Christ, working
destruction for those who follow them in such error. For
the astrologers, having declared the cosmos to be one,
divided it<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> into the twelve fixed parts of the Zodiacal signs,
and call the cosmos of the fixed Zodiacal signs one unwandering
world. But the other, they say, is the world of
the planets alike in power and in position and in number
which exists as far as the Moon.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> And that one world
receives from the other a certain power and communion,
and that things below partake of things above. But so
that what is said shall be made plain, I will use in part the
very words of the astrologers,<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> recalling to the readers
what was said before in the place where we set forth the
whole art of astrology. Their doctrines then are these:
From the emanation of the stars the genitures of things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
below are influenced. For the Chaldæans, scrutinizing

<span class="sidenote">p. 189.</span>

the heavens with great care, said that (the seven stars)
account for the active causes of everything which happens
to us; but that the degrees of the Zodiacal circle work
with them. (Then they divide the Zodiacal circle into)
12 parts, and each Zodiacal sign into 30 degrees and
each degree into 60 minutes; for these they call the least
and the undivided. And they call some of the
Zodiacal signs male and others female, some bicorporal
and others not, some tropical and others firm. Then
there are male or female according as they have a nature
co-operating in the begetting of males (or females).
Moved by which, I think<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> the Pythagoricians<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> call the
monad male, the dyad female, and the triad again male
and in like manner the rest of the odd and even numbers.
And some dividing each sign into dodecatemories employ

<span class="sidenote">p. 190.</span>

nearly the same plan. For example, in Aries they call the
first dodecatemory Aries and masculine, its second Taurus
and feminine, and its third Gemini and masculine, and so
on with the other parts. And they say that Gemini and
Sagittarius which stands opposite to it and Virgo and Pisces
are bicorporal signs, but the others not. And in like
manner, those signs are tropical in which the Sun turns
about and makes the turnings of the ambient, as, for
example, the sign Aries and its opposite Libra, Capricorn
and Cancer. For in Aries, the spring turning occurs, in
Capricorn the winter, in Cancer the summer and in Libra
the autumn. These things also and the system concerning
them we have briefly set forth in the book before this,
whence the lover of learning can learn how Euphrates the
Peratic and Celbes the Carystian, the founders of the
heresy, altering only the names, have really set down like
things, having also paid immoderate attention to the art.

<span class="sidenote">p. 191.</span>

For the astrologers also say that there are “terms” of the
stars in which they deem the ruling stars to have greater
power. For example in some (they do evil), but in others
good, of which they call these malefic and those benefic.
And they say that (the Planets) behold one another and are
in harmony with one another as they appear in trine (or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
square). Now the stars beholding one another are figured
in trine when they have a space of three signs between
them, but in square if they have two. And as in the
man the lower parts suffer with the head and the head
suffers with the lower parts, thus do the things on earth

<span class="sidenote">p. 192.</span>

with those above the Moon. But (yet) there is a certain
difference and want of sympathy between them since they
have not one and the same unity.</p>


<p>This alliance and difference of the stars, although a
Chaldæan (doctrine), those of whom we have spoken before
have taken as their own and have falsified the name of
truth. (For they) announce as the utterance of Christ a
strife of aeons and a falling-away of good powers to the bad,
and proclaim reconciliations of good and wicked.<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Then
they invoke Toparchs and Proastii,<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> making for themselves
also very many other names which are not obvious but
systematize unsystematically the whole idea of the astrologers
about the stars. As they have thus laid the foundation of
an enormous error they shall be completely refuted by our
appropriate arrangement. For I shall set side by side with
the aforesaid Chaldaic art of the astrologers some of the
doctrines of the Peratics, from which comparison it will be

<span class="sidenote">p. 193.</span>

understood how the words of the Peratics are avowedly those
of the astrologers, but not of Christ.</p>

<p>14. It seems well then to use for comparison a certain
one of the books<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> magnified by them wherein it is said:
“I am a voice of awaking from sleep in the aeon of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
night, (and) now I begin to lay bare the power from Chaos.
The power is the mud of the abyss, which raises the mire
of the imperishable watery void, the whole power of the
convulsion, pale as water, ever-moving, bearing with it the
stationary, holding back those that tremble, setting free
those that approach, relieving those that sigh, bringing
down those that increase, a faithful steward of the traces of
the winds, taking advantage of the things thrown up by the

<span class="sidenote">p. 194.</span>

twelve eyes of the Law,<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> showing a seal to the power which
arranges by itself the onrushing unseen water which is called
Thalassa.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Ignorance has called this power Kronos guarded
with chains since he bound together the maze of the dense
and cloudy and unknown and dark Tartarus. There are
born after the image of this (power) Cepheus, Prometheus,
Iapetus.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> (The) power to whom Thalassa is entrusted is
masculo-feminine, who traces back the hissing (water) from
the twelve mouths of the twelve pipes and after preparing
distributes it. (This power) is small and reduces the boisterous
restraining rising (of the sea) and seals up the ways
of her paths, so that nothing should declare war or suffer
change. The Typhonic daughter of this (power) is the faithful
guard of all sorts of waters. Her name is Chorzar. Ignorance
calls her Poseidôn, after whose likeness came Glaucus,
Melicertes, Iö,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Nebroë. He that is encircled with the 12-angled

Aoai, 3rd Ouô, 4th Ouöab, 5th ... Other faithful stewards
there are of his toparchy of day and night who rest in their
authority. Ignorance has called them the wandering stars
on which hangs perishable birth. Steward of the rising of
the wind<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> is Carphasemocheir (and second) Eccabaccara, but
ignorance calls these Curetes. (The) third ruler of the
winds is Ariel<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> after whose image came Æolus (and) Briares.
And ruler of the 12-houred night (is) Soclas<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> whom ignorance
has called Osiris. After his likeness there were born
Admetus, Medea, Hellen, Aethusa. Ruler of the 12-houred
day-time is Euno. He is steward of the rising of the first-blessed<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
and ætherial (goddess) whom ignorance calls Isis.
The sign of this (ruler) is the Dog-star<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> after whose image
were born Ptolemy son of Arsinoë, Didyme, Cleopatra,
Olympias. (The) right hand power of God is she whom

<span class="sidenote">p. 196.</span>

ignorance calls Rhea, after whose image were born Attis,
Mygdon,<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Oenone. The left-hand power has authority over
nurture whom ignorance calls Demeter. Her name is Bena.
After the likeness of this (god) were born Celeus, Triptolemus,
Misyr,<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Praxidice. (The) right-hand power has
authority over seasons. Ignorance calls this (god) Mena
after whose image were born, Bumegas,<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Ostanes, Hermes
Trismegistus, Curites, Zodarion, Petosiris, Berosos, Astrampsychos,
Zoroaster. (The) left-hand power of fire. Ignorance
calls him Hephæstus after whose image were born
Erichthonius, Achilleus, Capaneus, Phæthon, Meleager,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
Tydeus, Enceladus, Raphael, Suriel,<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Omphale. Three
middle powers suspended in air (are) causes of birth.
Ignorance calls them Fates, after whose image were born
(the) house of Priam, (the) house of Laius, Ino, Autonoë,
Agave, Athamas, Procne (the) Danaids, the Peliades. A
masculo-feminine power there is ever childlike, who grows
not old, (the) cause of beauty, of pleasure, of prime, of
yearning, of desire, whom ignorance calls Eros, after whose
image were born Paris, Narcissus, Ganymede, Endymion,

<span class="sidenote">p. 197.</span>

Tithonus, Icarius, Leda, Amymonê, Thetis, (the) Hesperides,
Jason, Leander, Hero.” These are the Proastii up to Aether.
For thus he inscribes the book.</p>

<p>15. The heresy of the Peratæ, it has been made easily
apparent to all, has been adapted from the (art) of the
astrologers with a change of names alone. And their other
books include the same method, if any one cared to go
through them. For, as I have said, they think the unbegotten
and overlying things to be the causes of birth of
the begotten, and that our world, which they call that of
form, came into being by emanation, and that all those stars
together which are beheld in the heaven become the causes
of birth in this world, they changing their names as is to be
seen from a comparison of the Proastii. And secondly after
the same fashion indeed, as they say that the world came
into being from the emanation of her<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> on high, thus they say
that things here have their birth and death and are governed

<span class="sidenote">p. 198.</span>

by the emanation from the stars. Since then the astrologers
know the Ascendant and Mid-heaven and the Descendant
and the Anti-meridian, and as the stars sometimes move
differently from the perpetual turning of the universe, and
at other times there are other succeedents to the cardinal
point and (other) cadents from the cardinal points, (the
Peratæ) treating the ordinance of the astrologers as an
allegory, picture the cardinal points as it were God and
monad and lord of all generation, and the succeedent as the
left hand and the cadent the right. When therefore any
one reading their writings finds a power spoken of by them
as right or left, let him refer to the centre, the succeedent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and the cadent, and he will clearly perceive that their whole
system of practice has been established on astrological
teaching.</p>

<p>16. But they call themselves Peratæ, thinking that nothing
which has its foundations in generation can escape the fate
determined from birth for the begotten. For if anything,
he says, is begotten it also perishes wholly, as it seemed also

<span class="sidenote">p. 199.</span>

to the Sibyl.<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> But, he says, we alone who know the compulsion
of birth and the paths whereby man enters into the
world and have been carefully instructed&mdash;we alone can pass
through<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and escape destruction. But water, he says, is
destruction, and never, he says, did the world perish quicker
than by water. But the water which rolls around the
Proastii is, they say, Kronos. For such a power, he says,
is of the colour of water and this power, that is Kronos,
none of those who have been founded in generation can
escape. For Kronos is set as a cause over every birth so
that it shall be subject to destruction<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and no birth could
occur in which Kronos is not an impediment. This, he
says is what the poets say and the gods (themselves) also
fear:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noin">But not only do the poets say this, he says, but also the

<span class="sidenote">p. 200.</span>

“For water becomes death to souls.”<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>This death (the Peratic) says seizes the Egyptians in the
Red Sea with their chariots. And all the ignorant, he says,
are Egyptians and this he says is the going out from Egypt
(that is) from the body. For they think the body little
Egypt (and) that it crosses over the Red Sea, that is, the
water of destruction which is Kronos, and that it is beyond
the Red Sea, that is birth, and comes into the desert, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
outside generation where are together the gods of destruction
and the god of salvation. But the gods of destruction, he
says, are the stars which bring upon those coming into
being the necessity of mutable generation. These, he said,
Moses called the serpents of the desert which bite and cause
to perish those who think they have crossed the Red Sea.
Therefore, he says, to those sons of Israel who were bitten
in the desert, Moses displayed the true and perfect serpent,
those who believed on which were not bitten in the desert,

<span class="sidenote">p. 201.</span>

that is, by the Powers. None then, he says, can save and
set free those brought forth from the land of Egypt, that is,
from the body and from this world, save only the perfect
serpent, the full of the full.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> He who hopes on this, he
says, is not destroyed by the serpents of the desert, that is, by
the gods of generation. It is written, he says, in a book of
Moses.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> This serpent, he says, is the Power which followed
Moses, the rod which was turned into a serpent. And the
serpents of the magicians who withstood the power of Moses
in Egypt were the gods of destruction; but the rod of Moses
overthrew them all and caused them to perish.</p>

<p>This universal serpent, he says, is the wise word of Eve.
This, he says, is the mystery of Edem, this the river flowing
out of Edem, this the mark which was set on Cain so that
all that found him should not kill him. This, he says, is
(that) Cain whose sacrifice was not accepted by the god
of this world; but he accepted the bloody sacrifice of Abel,
for the lord of this world delights in blood.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> He it is, he
says, who in the last days appeared in man’s shape in the

<span class="sidenote">p. 202.</span>

time of Herod, born after the image of Joseph who was
sold from the hand of his brethren and to whom alone
belonged the coat of many colours. This, he says, is he
after the image of Esau whose garment was blessed when
he was not present, who did not receive, he says, the blind
man’s blessing, but became rich elsewhere taking nothing
from the blind one, whose face Jacob saw as a man might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
see the face of God. Concerning whom he says, it is
written that: “Nebrod was a giant hunting before the
Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> There are, he says, as many counterparts of him as
there were serpents seen in the desert biting the sons of
Israel, from which that perfect one that Moses set up
delivered those that were bitten. This, he says, is the
saying: “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert,
so must the Son of Man be lifted up.”<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> After his likeness
was the brazen serpent in the desert which Moses set up.
The similitude of this alone is always seen in the heaven
in light. This he says is the mighty beginning about which
it is written. About this he says is the saying: “In the
beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and

<span class="sidenote">p. 203.</span>

the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by Him and without Him nothing
was. That which was in Him was life.”<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> And in Him, he
says, Eve came into being (and) Eve is life. She, he says
is Eve, mother of all living<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> (the) nature common (to all),
that is, to gods, angels, immortals, mortals, irrational beings,
and rational ones; for, he says, “to all” speaking collectively.
And if the eyes of any are blessed, he says, he will
see when he looks upward to heaven the fair image of the
serpent in the great summit<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> of heaven turning about and
becoming the source of all movement of all present things.
And (the beholder) will know that without Him there is
nothing framed of heavenly or of earthly things or of things
below the earth&mdash;neither night, nor moon, nor fruits, nor
generation, nor wealth, nor wayfaring, nor generally is there
anything of things which are that He does not point out.
In this, he says, is the great wonder beheld in the heavens
by those who can see.</p>

<p>For against this summit (that is) the head which is the
most difficult of all things to be believed by those who
know it not,</p>

<p>17. This is the variegated wisdom of the Peratic heresy,
which is difficult to describe completely, it being so
tangled through having been framed from the art of
astrology. So far as it was possible, therefore, we have set
forth all its force in few words. But in order to expound
their whole mind in epitome we think it right to add this:
According to them the universe is Father, Son and Matter.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>

<span class="sidenote">p. 205.</span>

Of these three every one contains within himself boundless
powers. Now midway between Matter and the Father sits
the Son, the Word, the Serpent, ever moving himself
towards the immoveable Father and towards Matter (which
itself) is moved. And sometimes he turns himself towards
the Father and receives the powers in his own person,<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and
when he has thus received them he turns towards Matter;
and Matter being without quality and formless takes pattern
from the forms<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> which the Son has taken as patterns from
the Father. But the Son takes pattern from the Father
unspeakably and silently and unchangeably, that is, as
Moses says the colours of the (sheep) that longed,<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> flowed
from the rods set up in the drinking-places. In such a way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
also did the powers flow from the Son to Matter according
to the yearning of the power which (flowed) from the rods
upon the things conceived. But the difference and unlikeness
of the colours which flowed from the rods through
the waters into the sheep is, he says, the difference of
corruptible and incorruptible birth. Or rather, as a painter
while taking nothing from the animals (he paints), yet
transfers with his pencil to the drawing-tablet all their forms,
thus the Son by his own power transfers to Matter the

<span class="sidenote">p. 206.</span>

types<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> of the Father. All things that are here are therefore
the Father’s types and nothing else. For if any one, he says
has strength enough to comprehend from the things here
that he is a type from the Father on high transferred hither
and made into a body, as in the conception from the rod,
he becomes white,<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> (and) wholly of one substance<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> with the
Father who is in the heavens, and returns thither. But if
he does not light upon this doctrine, nor discover the
necessity of birth, like an abortion brought forth in a night
he perishes in a night. Therefore, says he, when the
Saviour speaks of “Your Father who is in heaven”<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> He
means him from whom the Son takes the types and transfers
them hither. And when He says “Your father is a
manslayer from the beginning”<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> he means the Ruler and
Fashioner of Matter who receiving the types distributed by
the Son has produced children here. Who is a manslayer
from the beginning because his work makes for corruption
and death.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> None therefore, he says, can be saved nor

<span class="sidenote">p. 207.</span>

return (on high) save by the Son who is the Serpent. For
as he brought from on high the Father’s types, so he again
carries up from here those of them who have been awakened
and have become types of the Father, transferring them
thither from here as hypostatized from the Unhypostatized<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
One. This, he says, is the saying “I am the Door.” But
he transfers them, he says (as the light of vision)<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> to those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
whose eyelids are closed, as the naphtha draws everywhere
the fire to itself&mdash;or rather as the magnet the iron but
nothing else, or as the sea-hawk’s spine the gold but nothing
else, or as again (as) the chaff is drawn by the amber.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Thus,
he says, the perfect and consubstantial race which has been
made the image<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> (of the Father) but nought else is again
led from the world by the Serpent, just as it was sent down
here by him.</p>

<p>For the proof of this they bring forward the anatomy of
the brain, likening the cerebrum to the Father from its
immobility, and the cerebellum to the Son from its being
moved and existing in serpent form. Which (last) they
imagine ineffably and without giving any sign to attract

<span class="sidenote">p. 208.</span>

through the pineal gland the spiritual and life-giving
substance emanating from the Blessed One.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Receiving
which the cerebellum, as the Son silently transfers the
forms to Matter, spreads abroad the seeds and genera of
things born after the flesh, to the spinal marrow. By the
use of this simile, they seem to introduce cleverly their
ineffable mysteries handed down in silence which it is not
lawful for us to utter. Nevertheless they will easily be
comprehended from what I have said.</p>

<p>18. But since I think I have set forth clearly the Peratic
heresy and by many words have made plain what had
escaped (notice), and since it has mixed up everything with
everything concealing its own peculiar poison, it seems right
to proceed no further with the charge, the opinions laid
down by them being sufficient accusation against them.<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>


<h3 id="V_3">3. <i>The Sethiani.</i></h3>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 209.</span>19. Let us see then what the Sethians say.<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> They are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
of opinion<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> that there are three definite principles of the
universals, and that each of the principles contains boundless
powers. But what they mean by powers let him judge
who hears them speak thus: Everything which you understand
by your mind or which you pass by unthought of,
is formed by nature to become each of these principles, as
in the soul of man every art which is taught. For example,
he says, that a boy will become a piper if he spend some time
with a piper, or a geometrician if he does so with a geometrician,
or a grammarian with a grammarian, or a carpenter
with a carpenter, and to one in close contact with other
trades it will happen in the same way. But the substance
of the principles, he says, are light and darkness; and
between them there is uncontaminated spirit. But the
spirit which is set between the darkness below and the light
on high, is not breath like a gust of wind or some little

<span class="sidenote">p. 210.</span>

breeze which can be perceived, but resembles some faint
perfume of balsam or of incense artificially compounded, as
a power penetrating by force of a fragrance inconceivable
and better than can be said in speech. But since the light
is above and the darkness below and the spirit as has been
said between them, the light naturally shines like a ray of
the sun on high on the underlying darkness, and again the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
fragrance of the spirit having the middle place spreads
abroad and is borne in all directions, as we observe the
fragrance of the incense burnt in the fire carried everywhere.
And such being the power of the triply divided, the power
of the spirit and of the light together is in the darkness
which is ranged below them. But the darkness is a fearful
water, into which the light with the spirit is drawn down
and transformed into such a nature (as the water).<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> And
the darkness is not witless, but prudent completely, and
knows that if the light be taken from the darkness,
the darkness remains desolate, viewless, without light,

<span class="sidenote">p. 211.</span>

powerless, idle, and strengthless. Wherefore with all its
sense and wit it is forced to detain within itself the brilliance
and spark of the light with the fragrance of the spirit. And
an image of their nature is to be seen in the face of man,
(to wit) the pupil of the eye dark from the underlying fluids,
(and) lighted up by (the) spirit. As then the darkness seeks
after the brilliance, that it may hold the spark as a slave
and may see, so do the light and the spirit seek after their
own power, and make haste to raise up and take back to
themselves their powers which have been mingled with the
underlying dark and fearful water.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> But all the powers of
the three principles being everywhere boundless in number
are each of them wise and understanding as regards its own
substance, and the countless multitude of them being wise
and understanding, whenever they remain by themselves
are all at rest. But if one power draws near to another,
the unlikeness of (the things in) juxtaposition effects a
certain movement and activity formed from the movement,
by the coming together and juxtaposition of the meeting

<span class="sidenote">p. 212.</span>

powers. For the coming together of the powers comes
to pass like some impression of a seal struck by close
conjunction for the sealing of the substances brought up (to
it).<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Since then the powers of the three principles are
boundless in number and the conjunctions of the boundless
powers (also) boundless, there must needs be produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
images of boundless seals. Now these images are the
forms<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> of the different animals.</p>

<p>From the first great conjunction then of the three
principles came into being a certain great form of a seal,
(to wit) heaven and earth. And heaven and earth are
planned very like a matrix having the navel<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> in the midst.
And if, he says, one wishes to have this design under his
eyes, let him examine with skill the pregnant womb of any
animal he pleases, and he will discover the type of heaven
and earth and of all those things between which lie unchangeably
below. And the appearance of heaven and
earth became by the first conjunction such as to be like a
womb. But again between heaven and earth boundless
conjunctions of powers have occurred. And each conjunction
wrought and stamped<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> nothing else than a seal of

<span class="sidenote">p. 213.</span>

heaven and earth like a womb. But within this (the earth)
there grew from the boundless seals boundless multitudes
of different animals. And into all this infinity which is
under heaven there was scattered and distributed among the
different animals, together with the light, the fragrance of the
spirit from on high.</p>

<p>Then there came into being from the water the first-born<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
principle (to wit) a wind violent and turbulent and the
cause of all generation. For making some agitation in
the waters it raises waves in them. But the motion of the
waves as if it were some impregnating impulse is a beginning
of generation of man or beast when it is driven
onward swollen by the impulse of the spirit. But when
this wave has been raised from the water and made pregnant
in the natural way, and has received within itself the
feminine power of reproduction, it retains the light scattered
from on high together with the fragrance of the spirit&mdash;that

<span class="sidenote">p. 214.</span>

is mind given shape in the different species.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> Which
(mind) is a perfect God, who is brought down from the
unbegotten light on high and from the spirit into man’s
nature as into a temple, by the force of nature and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
movement of the wind. It has been engendered from the
water (and) commingled and mixed with the bodies as if it
were (the) salt of the things which are and a light of the darkness
struggling to be freed from the bodies and not able to
find deliverance and its way out. For some smallest spark
from the light (has been mingled) with the fragrance from
above (<i>i. e.</i> from the spirit), like a ray (making composition
of things dissolved and) solution of things compounded as,
he says, is said in a psalm.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Therefore every thought and
care of the light on high is how and in what way the mind
may be set free from the death of the wicked and dark
body (and) from the Father of that which is below, who
is the wind which raised the waves in agitation and disorder

<span class="sidenote">p. 215.</span>

and has begotten Nous his own perfect son, not being his
own (son) as to substance.<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> For he was a ray from on
high from that perfect light overpowered in the dark and
fearful bitter and polluted water, which (ray) is the shining
spirit borne above the water. When then the waves (raised
from the) waters [have received within themselves the
feminine power of reproduction, they detain in<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>] the
different species, like some womb, (the light) scattered
(from on high), (with the fragrance of the spirit) as is seen
in all animals.</p>

<p>But the wind at once violent and turbulent is borne
along like the hissing of a serpent. First then from the
wind, that is from the serpent, came the principle of
generation in the way aforesaid,<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> all things having received
the principle of generation at the same time. When then
the light and the spirit were received into the unpurified

<span class="sidenote">p. 216.</span>

and much suffering disordered womb, the serpent, the wind
of the darkness, the first-born of the waters entering in,
begets man, and the unpurified womb neither loves nor
recognizes any other form (but the serpent’s).<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Then the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
perfect Word of the light on high, having been made like
the beast, the serpent, entered into the unpurified womb,
beguiling it by its likeness to the beast, so that it might
loose the bands which encircle the Perfect Mind which was
begotten in the impurity of the womb by the first-born of
the water, (to wit) the serpent, the beast. This, he says,
is the form of the slave<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and this the need for the descent
of the Word of God into the womb of a Virgin. But it is
not enough, he says, that the Perfect Man, the Word, has
entered into the womb of a virgin and has loosed the pangs
which were in that darkness. But in truth after entering
into the foul mysteries of the womb, He was washed<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and
drank of the cup of living bubbling water, which he must
needs drink who was about to do off the slave-like form
and do on a heavenly garment.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 217.</span>20. This is what the champions of the Sethianian doctrines
say, to put it shortly. But their system is made up of
sayings by physicists and of words spoken in respect of
other matters, which they transfer to their own system and
explain as we have said. And they say that Moses also
supported their theory when he said “Darkness, gloom
and whirlwind.” These, he says, are the three words. Or
when he says that there were three born in Paradise, Adam,
Eve (and the) Serpent; or when he says three (others),
Cain, Abel (and) Seth; and yet again three, Shem, Ham
(and) Japhet; or when he speaks of three patriarchs,
Abraham, Isaac, (and) Jacob; or when he says that there
existed three days before the Sun and Moon; or when he
says that there are three laws (the) prohibitive, (the) permissive
and the punitive. And a prohibitive law is: “From
every tree in Paradise thou mayest eat the fruit, but of the
tree of knowledge of good and evil, eat not.” But in this
saying: “Go forth from thine own land, and from thy
kindred and (thou shalt come) hither into a land which I
shall show thee.” This law he says is permissive for he who
chooses may go forth and he who chooses may remain.
But the law is punitive which says “Thou shalt not commit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
adultery, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not murder”&mdash;for
to each of these sins there is a penalty.<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 218.</span>But the whole teaching of their system is taken from
the ancient theologists Musæus, Linus and he who most
especially makes known the initiations and mysteries (to
wit), Orpheus. For their discourse about the womb is also
that of Orpheus; and the phallus, which is virility, is thus
explicitly mentioned in the <i>Bacchica</i> of Orpheus.<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> And these
things were made the subject of initiation and were handed
down to men, before the initiatory rite of Celeus, Triptolemus,
Demeter, Core and Dionysos in Eleusis, at Phlium in Attica.
For earlier than the Eleusinian Mysteries are the secret rites
of the so-called Great (Mother) in Phlium. For there is in
that (town) a porch, and on the porch to this day is engraved
the representation of all the words spoken (in them).

<span class="sidenote">p. 219.</span>

Many things are engraved on that porch concerning which
Plutarch also makes discourse in his ten books against
Empedocles. And on the doors is engraved a certain old
man grey-haired, winged, having his <i>pudendum</i> stretched
forth, pursuing a fleeing woman of a blue colour. And
there is written over the old man “Phaos ruentes” and over
the woman “Pereēphicola.” But “phaos ruentes” seems
to be the light according to the theory of the Sethians
and the “phicola” the dark water, while between them is
at an interval the harmony of the spirit. And the name of
“Phaos ruentes” denotes the rushing below of the light as
they say from on high. So that we may reasonably say
that the Sethians celebrate among themselves (rites) in
some degree akin to the Phliasian Mysteries of the Great
(Mother).<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> And to the triple division of things the poet
seems to bear witness when he says:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And in three lots were all things divided</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And each drew his own domain.”&mdash;</div>
    <div class="right">(Homer, <i>Il.</i>, XV, 189.<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">that is each of the threefold divisions has taken power.

<span class="sidenote">p. 220.</span>

And, as for the underlying dark water below, that the light
has plunged into it and that the spark borne down (into it)
ought to be restored and taken on high from it, the all-wise
Sethians seem to have here borrowed from Homer when
he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let earth be witness and wide heaven above</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the water of Styx that flows below</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The greatest oath and most terrible to the blessed gods.”<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>&mdash;</div>
    <div class="right">(<i>Il.</i> XV, 36-38.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">That is, the gods, according to Homer, think water something
ill-omened and frightful, wherefore the theory of the
Sethians says it is frightful to the Nous.</p>

<p>21. This is what they say and other things like it in
endless writings. And they persuade those who are their
disciples to read the theory of Composition and Mixture<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
which is studied by many others and by Andronicus the
Peripatetic. The Sethians then say that the theory about
Composition and Mixture is to be framed after this fashion:
The light ray from on high has been compounded and the

<span class="sidenote">p. 221.</span>

very small spark has been lightly mingled<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> in the dark
waters below, and (these two) have united and exist in one
mass as one odour (results) from the many kinds of incense
on the fire. And the expert who has as his test an acute
sense of smell ought to delicately distinguish from the sole
smell of the incense the different kinds of it set on the fire;
as (for example) if it be storax and myrrh and frankincense
or if anything else be mixed with it. And they make use
of other comparisons, as when they say that if brass has
been mixed with gold, a certain process<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> has been discovered
which separates the gold from the brass. And in like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
manner if tin or brass or anything of the same kind be
found mixed with silver, these by some better process of
alloy are also separated. But even now any one distinguishes
water mixed with wine. Thus, he says, if all things are
mingled together they are distinguished. And truly, he
says, learn from the animals. For when the animal is dead
each (of its parts) is separated (from the rest) and thus when
dissolved, the animal disappears. This he says is the
saying: “I come not to bring peace upon the earth but a
sword”<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>&mdash;that is to cut in twain and separate the things

<span class="sidenote">p. 222.</span>

which have been compounded together. For each of the
compounds is cut in twain and separated when it lights on
its proper place. For as there is one place of composition
for all the animals, so there has been set up one place of
dissolution, which no man knoweth, he says, save only we
who are born again, spiritual not fleshly, whose citizenship is
in the heavens above.</p>

<p>With these insinuations they corrupt their hearers, both
when they misuse words, turning good sayings into bad as
they wish, and when they conceal their own iniquity by
what comparisons they choose. All things then, he says,
which are compounds have their own peculiar place and run
towards their own kindred things as the iron to the magnet,
the straw to the amber, and the gold to the sea-hawk’s
spine.<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> And thus the (ray) of light which was mingled with
the water having received from teaching and learning (the
knowledge of) its own proper place hastens to the Word
come from on high in slave-like form and becomes with the
Word a Word where the Word is, more (quickly) than the
iron (flies) to the magnet.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 223.</span>And that these things are so, he says, and that all compounded
things are separated at their proper places, learn
(thus):&mdash;There is among the Persians in the city Ampa
near the Tigris a well, and near this well and above it has
been built a cistern having three outlets. From which well
if one draws, and takes up in a jar what is drawn from the
well whatever it is and pours it into the cistern hard by;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
when it comes to the outlets and is received from each
outlet in one vessel, it separates itself. And in the first
outlet is exhibited an incrustation<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> of salt, and in the second
bitumen, and in the third oil. But the oil is black, as he
says Herodotus also recounts,<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> has a heavy odour and the
Persians call it <i>rhadinace</i>. This simile of the well, say the
Sethians, suffices for the truth of their proposition better
than all that has been said above.</p>

<p>22. The opinion of the Sethians seems to us to have been
made tolerably plain. But if any one wishes to learn the
whole of their system let him read the book inscribed
<i>Paraphrase (of) Seth</i>; for all their secrets he will find there
enshrined.<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> But since we have set forth the things of the

<span class="sidenote">p. 224.</span>

Sethians<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> let us see also what Justinus thinks.</p>


<h3 id="V_4" title="4. Justinus.">4. <i>Justinus.</i><a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></h3>

<p>23. Justinus, being utterly opposed to every teaching of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the Holy Scriptures, and also to the writing or speech<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> of
the blessed Evangelists, since the Word taught his disciples
saying: “Go not into the way of the Gentiles”<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>&mdash;which is
plainly: Give no heed to the vain teaching of the Gentiles&mdash;seeks
to bring back his hearers to the marvel-mongering of
the Greeks and what is taught by it. He sets out word for
word and in detail the fabulous tales of the Greeks, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
neither teaches first hand<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> nor hands down his own complete
mystery unless he has bound the dupe by an oath.
Thereafter he explains the myth for the purpose of winning
souls,<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> so that those who read the numberless follies of the
books shall have the fables as consolation<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>&mdash;as if one
tramping along a road and coming across an inn should see
fit to rest&mdash;and so that when they have again turned to the

<span class="sidenote">p. 225.</span>

full study of the things read, they may not detest them
until, being led on by the rush of the crowd, they have
plunged into the offence artfully contrived by him, having
first bound them by fearful oaths neither to utter nor to
abandon his teaching and compelling them to accept it.
Thus he delivers to them the mysteries impiously sought out by
him, using as aforesaid the Greek myths and partly corrupted
books according to what they indicate of the aforesaid
heresies. For they all, drawn by one spirit, are led into a
deep pit (of error) but each narrates and mythologizes the
same things differently. But they all call themselves
especially Gnostics, as if they alone had drunk in the
knowledge of the perfect and good.</p>

<p>24. But swear, says Justinus, if you wish to know the
things “which eye hath not seen nor ear heard, nor have
they entered into the heart of man,”<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> (that is) Him who is
good above all things, the Highest, to keep the ineffable
secrets of the teaching. For our Father also, when he saw
the Good One and was perfected by him, kept silence as to

<span class="sidenote">p. 226.</span>

the secrets<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and swore as it is written: “The Lord sware
and will not repent.”<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Having then thus sealed up these
(secrets), he turns their minds to many myths through a
quantity (of books), and thus leads to the Good One, perfecting
the mystæ by unspoken mysteries. But we shall
not travel through more (of his works). We shall give as a
sample the ineffable things from one book of his, it being
one which he clearly thinks of high repute. It is inscribed
<i>Baruch</i>.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> We shall disclose one myth set forth in it by him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
out of many, it being also in Herodotus. Having transformed<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
this, he tells it to his hearers as new, the whole
system of his teaching being made up out of it.</p>

<p>25. Now Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> says that Heracles when driving
Geryon’s oxen from Erytheia<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> came to Scythia and being
wearied by the way lay down to sleep in some desert place
for a short time. While he was asleep his horse disappeared,
mounted on which he had made his long journey.<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> On
waking he made search over most of the desert in the
attempt to find his horse. He entirely misses the horse,

<span class="sidenote">p. 227.</span>

but finding a certain semi-virgin girl<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> in the desert, he asks
her if she had seen the horse anywhere. The girl said that
she had seen it, but would not at first show it to him unless
Heracles would go with her to have connection with her.
But Herodotus says that the upper part of the girl as far as
the groin was that of a virgin, but that the whole body below
the groin had in some sort the frightful appearance of a viper.
But Heracles, being in a hurry to find his horse yielded to
the beast. For he knew her and made her pregnant, and
foretold to her after connection that she had in her womb
three sons by him who would be famous.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> And he bade
her when they were born to give them the names Agathyrsus,
Gelonus, and Scytha. And taking the horse from the beast-like
girl as his reward, he went away with his oxen. But
after this, there is a long story in Herodotus.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Let us
dismiss it at present. But we will explain something of
what Justinus teaches when he turns this myth into (one of)
the generation of the things of the universe.</p>

<p>26. This he says: There were three unbegotten principles
of the universals,<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> two male and one female. And

<span class="sidenote">p. 228.</span>

of the male, one is called the Good One, he alone being
thus called, and he has foreknowledge of the universals.
And the second is the Father of all begotten things, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
having foreknowledge and being (unknowable and)<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> invisible.
But the female is without foreknowledge, passionate,
two-minded, two-bodied, in all things resembling Herodotus’
myth, a virgin to the groin and a viper below, as
says Justinus. And this maiden is called Edem and Israel.
These, he says, are the principles of the universals, their
roots and sources, by which all things came into being,
beside which nothing was. Then the Father without foreknowledge,
beholding the semi-virgin, who was Edem, came
to desire of her. This Father, he says, is called Elohim.<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>
Not less did Edem desire Elohim, and desire brought them
together into one favour of love. And the Father from such
congress begot on Edem twelve angels of his own. And the
names of these angels of the Father are: Michael, Amen,
Baruch, Gabriel, Esaddæus.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>... And the names of the
angels of the Mother which Edem created are likewise set
down. These are: Babel, Achamoth, Naas, Bel, Belias,

<span class="sidenote">p. 229.</span>

Satan, Saêl, Adonaios, Kavithan, Pharaoh, Karkamenos,
Lathen.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Of these twenty-four angels the paternal ones join
with the Father and do everything in accordance with his will,
but the maternal angels (side) with the Mother, Edem. And
he says that Paradise is the multitude of these angels taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
together; concerning which Moses says: “God planted a
Paradise in Edem towards the East,”<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> that is, towards the
face of Edem that Edem might ever behold Paradise, that
is, the angels. And the angels of this Paradise are allegorically
called trees,<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> and Baruch, the third angel of the
Father, is the Tree of Life, and Naas, the third angel of
the Mother is the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
For thus, he says, the (words) of Moses ought to be interpreted,
saying: Moses declared them covertly, because all
do not come to the truth.</p>

<p>But he says also when Paradise was produced from the
mutual pleasure of Elohim and Edem, the angels of Elohim
taking (dust) from the fairest earth, that is, not from the
beast-like parts of Edem, but from the man-like and cultivated
regions of the earth above the groin, create man.
But from the beast-like parts, he says, the wild beasts and

<span class="sidenote">p. 230.</span>

other animals are produced. Now they made man as a
symbol of their<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> unity and good-will and placed in him the
powers of each, Edem (supplying) the soul and Elohim the
spirit.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> And there thus came into being a certain seal, as
it were and actual memorial of love and an everlasting sign
of the marriage of Elohim and Edem, (to wit) a man who is
Adam. And in like manner also, Eve came into being as
Moses has written, an image and a sign and a seal to be for
ever preserved of Edem. And there was likewise placed in
Eve the image, a soul from Edem but a spirit from Elohim.
And commands were given to them, “Increase and multiply
and replenish the earth,”<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> that is Edem, for so he would
have it written. For the whole of her own power Edem
brought to Elohim as it were some dowry in marriage.
Whence, he says, in imitation of that first marriage, women
unto this day bring freely to their husbands in obedience to
a certain divine and ancestral law (a dowry) which is that
of Edem to Elohim.</p>

<p>But when heaven and earth and the things which were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
therein had been created as it is written by Moses, the
twelve angels of the Mother were divided into four authorities
and each quarter, he says, is called a river, (to wit)
Phison and Gihon, Tigris and Euphrates, as Moses says:

<span class="sidenote">p. 231.</span>

These twelve angels visiting the four parts encompass and
arrange the world, having a certain satrapial<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> power over
the world by the authority of Edem. But they abide not
always in their own places, but as it were in a circular dance,
they go about exchanging place for place, and at certain
times and intervals giving up the places assigned to them.
When Phison has rule over the places, famine, distress and
affliction come to pass in that part of the world, for miserly
is the array of these angels. And in like manner in each
of the quarters according to the nature and power of each,
come evil times and troops of diseases. And evermore the
flow of evil according to the rule of the quarters, as if they
were rivers, by the will of Edem goes unceasingly about the
world.</p>

<p>But from some such cause as this did the necessity of
evil come about.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> When Elohim had built and fashioned

<span class="sidenote">p. 232.</span>

the world from mutual pleasure, he wished to go up to the
highest parts of heaven and to see whether any of the
things of creation lacked aught. And he took his own
angels with him, for he was (by nature) one who bears
upward, and left below Edem, for she being earth did not
wish to follow her spouse on high. Then Elohim coming to
the upper limit of heaven and beholding a light better than
that which himself had fashioned, said: “Open unto me
the gates that I may enter in and acknowledge the Lord:
For I thought that I was the Lord.”<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> And a voice from
the light answered him, saying: “This is the gate of the
Lord (and) the just enter through it.” And straightway the
gate was opened, and the Father entered without his angels
into the presence of the Good One and saw “what eye has
not seen nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of
man.” Then the Good One says to him, “Sit thou on my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
right hand.”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> But the Father says to the Good One:
“Suffer me, O Lord, to overturn the world which I have
made; for my spirit is bound in men and I wish to recover
it.” Then says the Good One to him: “While with me
thou canst do no evil; for thou and Edem made the world
from mutual pleasure. Let therefore Edem hold creation

<span class="sidenote">p. 233.</span>

while she will;<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> but do thou abide with me.” Then Edem
knowing that she had been abandoned by Elohim was
grieved, and sat beside her own angels and adorned herself
gloriously lest haply Elohim coming to desire of her should
descend to her.</p>

<p>But since Elohim being ruled by the Good One did not
come down to Edem, she gave command to Babel, who is
Aphrodite, to bring about fornication and dissolutions of
marriage among men, in order that as she was separated
from Elohim, so also might the (spirit) of Elohim which is
in men be tortured, (and) grieved by such separations and
might suffer the same things as she did on being abandoned.
And Edem gave great power to her third angel Naas,<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> that
he might punish with all punishments the spirit of Elohim
which is in men, so that through the spirit Elohim might
be punished for having left his spouse contrary to their
vows. The Father Elohim seeing this sent forth his third
angel Baruch to the help of the spirit which is in men.

<span class="sidenote">p. 234.</span>

Then Baruch came again and stood in the midst of the
angels&mdash;for the angels are Paradise in the midst of which
he stood&mdash;and gave commandment to the man: “From
every tree which is in Paradise freely eat, but from (the
tree) of Knowledge of Good and Evil eat not,”<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> which tree
is Naas. That is to say: Obey the eleven other angels of
Edem for the eleven have passions, but have no transgression.
But Naas had transgression, for he went in unto Eve
and beguiled her and committed adultery with her, which is
a breach of the Law. And he went in also unto Adam and
used him as a boy which is also a breach of the Law.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>
Thence came adultery and sodomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>From that time vices bore sway over men, and the good
things came from a single source, the Father. For he,
having gone up to the presence of the Good One showed
the way to those who wished to go on high; but his having
withdrawn from Edem made a source of ills to the spirit of

<span class="sidenote">p. 235.</span>

the Father which is in men. Therefore Baruch was sent to
Moses, and through him spoke to the sons of Israel that
he might turn them towards the Good One. But the third<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
(angel Naas) by means of the soul which came from Edem
to Moses as also to all men, darkened the commandments
of Baruch and made them listen to his own. Therefore the
soul is arrayed against the spirit and the spirit against the
soul.<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> For the soul is Edem and the spirit Elohim, each
of them being in all mankind, both females and males.
Again after this, Baruch was sent to the Prophets, so that
by their means the spirit which dwells in man might
hearken and flee from Edem and the device of wickedness<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
as the Father Elohim had fled. And in like manner and
by the same contrivance, Naas by the soul which inhabits
man along with the spirit of the Father seduced the
Prophets, and they were all led astray and did not follow
the words of Baruch which Elohim had commanded.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">p. 236.</span>In the sequel, Elohim chose Heracles as a prophet out of
the uncircumcision and sent him that he might fight against
the twelve angels of the creation of the wicked ones. These
are the twelve contests of Heracles which he fought in
their order from the first to the last against the lion, the
bear, the wild boar,<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and the rest. For these are the names
of the nations which have been changed, they say, by the
action of the angels of the Mother. But when he seemed
to have prevailed, Omphale, who is Babel or Aphrodite<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
becomes connected with him and leads astray Heracles,
strips him of his power (which is) the commands of Baruch
which Elohim commanded, and puts other clothes on him,
her own robe, which is the power of Edem who is below.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
And thus the power of prophecy<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> of Heracles and his
works become imperfect.</p>

<p>Last of all in the days of Herod the king, Baruch is again
sent below by Elohim and coming to Nazareth finds Jesus,
the son of Joseph and Mary,<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> a boy of twelve years old,
feeding sheep, and teaches Him all things from the beginning
which came about from Edem and Elohim and the things

<span class="sidenote">p. 237.</span>

which shall be hereafter, and he said: “All the prophets
before thee were led astray. Strive, therefore, O Jesus,
Son of Man, that thou be not led astray, but preach this
word unto men. And proclaim to them the things touching
the Father and the Good One, and go on high to the Good
One and sit there with Elohim the Father of us all.” And
Jesus hearkened to the angel, saying: “Lord, I will do all
(these) things,” and He preached. Then Naas wished to
lead astray this one also (but Jesus did not wish to hearken
to him)<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> for He remained faithful to Baruch. Then Naas,
angered because he could not lead Him astray, made Him
to be crucified. But He, leaving the body of Edem on the
Cross, went on high to the Good One. But He said to
Edem: “Woman, receive thy Son,”<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> that is the natural
and earthly man, and commending<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> the spirit into the
hands of the Father went on high to the presence of the
Good One.</p>

<p>But the Good One is Priapus, who before anything was,
was created. Whence he is called Priapus because he
previously made<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> all things. Wherefore he says he is set
up before every temple<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> being honoured by the whole
creation and in the streets bears the blossoms of creation
on his head, that is the fruits of creation of which he is the

<span class="sidenote">p. 238.</span>

cause having first made the creation which before did not
exist. When therefore you hear men say that a swan came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
upon Leda and begot children from her, the swan is Elohim
and Leda is Edem. And when men say that an eagle came
upon Ganymede, the eagle is Naas and Ganymede is Adam.
And when they say that the gold came upon Danae and
begot children from her, the gold is Elohim and Danae is
Edem. And likewise they making parallels in the same
way teach all such words as bring in myths. When then
the Prophets say: “Hear O Heaven and give ear O Earth,
the Lord has spoken,”<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Heaven means, he says, the spirit
which is in man from Elohim and Earth the soul which is
in man (together) with the spirit, and the Lord means
Baruch, and Israel, Edem. For Edem is also called Israel
the spouse of Elohim. “Israel,” he says, “knew me not;
for if she had known that I was with the Good One, she
would not have punished the spirit which is in man through
the Father’s ignorance.”</p>

<p>27. Afterwards ... is written also the oath in the first

<span class="sidenote">p. 239.</span>

book which is inscribed Baruch which those swear who are
about to hear these mysteries and to be perfected<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> by the
Good One. Which oath, he says, our Father Elohim swore
when in the presence of the Good One and having sworn
did not repent, touching which, he says, it is written: “The
Lord sware and did not repent.” This is that oath: “I
swear by Him who is above all, the Good One, to preserve
these mysteries and to utter them to none, nor to turn away
from the Good One to creation.” And when he has sworn
that oath he enters into the presence of the Good One and
sees “what eye hath not seen nor ear heard and it has not
entered into the heart of man,” and he drinks from the
living water, which is their font, as they think, the well
of living, sparkling water. For there is a distinction, he
says, between water and water; and there is the water below
the firmament of the bad creation, wherein are baptized<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
the earthly and natural men, and there is the living water

<span class="sidenote">p. 240.</span>

above the firmament of the Good One in which Elohim was
baptized and having been baptized did not repent. And
when the prophet declares, he says, to take unto himself a
wife of whoredom because the earth whoring has committed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
whoredom from behind the Lord,<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> that is Edem from
Elohim. In these words, he says, the prophet speaks
clearly the whole mystery, but he was not hearkened to by
the wickedness of Naas. In that same fashion also they
hand down other prophetic sayings in many books. But
pre-eminent among them is the book inscribed Baruch in
which he who reads will know the whole management of
their myth.</p>

<p>Now, though I have met with many heresies, beloved, I
have met with none worse than this. But truly, as the
saying is, we ought, imitating his Heracles, to cleanse the
Augean dunghill or rather trench, having fallen into which
his followers will never be washed clean nor indeed be able
to come up out of it.</p>

<p>28. Since then we have set forth the designs of Justinus
the Gnostic falsely so called, it seems fitting to set forth also

<span class="sidenote">p. 241.</span>

<h3>FOOTNOTES</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_472" href="#FNanchor_472" class="label">[1]</a> In this chapter, Hippolytus treats of what is probably a late form
of the Ophite heresy, certainly one of the first to enter into rivalry with
the Catholic Church. For its doctrines and practices, the reader must
be referred to the chapter on the Ophites in the translator’s <i>Forerunners
and Rivals of Christianity</i>, vol. II; but it may be said here that
it seems to have sprung from a combination of the corrupt Judaism then
practised in Asia Minor with the Pagan myths or legends prevalent all
over Western Asia, which may some day be traced back to the Sumerians
and the earliest civilization of which we have any record. Yet the
Ophites admitted the truth of the Gospel narrative, and asserted the
existence of a Supreme Being endowed with the attributes of both
sexes and manifesting Himself to man by means of a Deity called His
son, who was nevertheless identified with both the masculine and
feminine aspects of his Father. This triad, which the Ophites called
the First Man, the Second Man, and the First Woman or Holy Spirit,
they represented as creating the planetary worlds as well as the “world
of form,” by the intermediary of an inferior power called Sophia or
Wisdom and her son Jaldabaoth, who is expressly stated to be the God
of the Jews.</p>

<p>All this we knew before the discovery of our text from the statements
of heresiologists like St. Irenæus and Epiphanius; but Hippolytus goes
further than any other author by connecting these Ophite theories with
the worship of the Mother of the Gods or Cybele, the form under which
the triune deity of Western Asia was best known in Europe. The unnamed
Naassene or Ophite author from whom he quotes without intermission
throughout the chapter, seems to have got hold of a hymn to Attis
used in the festivals of Cybele, in which Attis is, after the syncretistic fashion
of post-Alexandrian paganism, identified with the Syrian Adonis, the
Egyptian Osiris, the Greek Dionysos and Hermes, and the Samothracian
or Cabiric gods Adamna and Corybas; and the chapter is in
substance a commentary on this hymn, the order of the lines of which
it follows closely. This commentary tries to explain or “interpret”
the different myths there referred to by passages from the Old and New
Testaments and from the Greek poets dragged in against their manifest
sense and in the wildest fashion. Most of these supposed allusions,
indeed, can only be justified by the most outrageous play upon words,
and it may be truly said that not a single one of them when naturally
construed bears the slightest reference to the matter in hand. Yet
they serve not only to elucidate the Ophite beliefs, but give, as it were
accidentally, much information as to the scenes enacted in the Eleusinian
and other heathen mysteries which was before lacking. The author
also quotes two hymns used apparently in the Ophite worship which are
not only the sole relics of a once extensive literature, but are a great
deal better evidence as to Gnostic tenets than his own loose and equivocal
statements.</p>

<p>As the legend of Attis and Cybele may not be familiar to all, it may
be well to give a brief abstract of it as found in Pausanias, Diodorus
Siculus, Ovid, and the Christian writer Arnobius. Cybele, called also
Agdistis, Rhea, Gê, or the Great Mother, was said to have been born from
a rock accidentally fecundated by Zeus. On her first appearance she was
hermaphrodite, but on the gods depriving her of her virility it passed
into an almond-tree. The fruit of this was plucked by the virgin
daughter of the river Sangarios, who, placing it in her bosom, became
by it the mother of Attis, fairest of mankind. Attis at his birth was
exposed on the river-bank, but was rescued, brought up as a goatherd,
and was later chosen as a husband by the king’s daughter. At the marriage
feast, Cybele, fired by jealousy, broke into the palace and, according
to one version of the story, emasculated Attis who died of the hurt. Then
Cybele repented and prayed to Zeus to restore him to life, which prayer
was granted by making him a god. The ceremonies of the Megalesia
celebrating the Death and Resurrection of Attis as held in Rome
during the late Republic and early Empire, and their likeness to the
Easter rites of the Christian Church are described in the <i>Journal</i> of the
Royal Asiatic Society for October 1917.</p>

by Jaldabaoth and his six sons. The same story was current among the
followers of Saturninus (<i>Irenæus</i>, I, xviii, p. 197, Harvey) and other
Gnostic sects, who agree with the text as to his helplessness when first

see <i>Forerunners</i>, II, pp. 292 ff.) the First Man is taken prisoner by
the powers of darkness. Both this and that in the text are doubtless
survivals of some legend current throughout Western Asia at a very

name of no heretical author as he does in the following chapters of this
Book. It is probable, therefore, that he may have taken down his
account of “Naassene” doctrines from the lips of some convert, which
would account for the extreme wildness of the quotations and to the
incoherence with which he jumps about from one subject to another.
This would also account for the heresy here described being far more
Christian in tone than the other forms of Ophitism which follow it in
the text, and the quotations from Scripture, especially the N.T., being
more numerous and on the whole more apposite than in the succeeding
chapters. The style, such as it is, is maintained throughout and its
continuity should perhaps forbid us to see in it a plurality of authors.
Little prominence in it is given to the Serpent which gives its name to
the sect, although it is here said that he is good, and this seems to
point to the Naassene being more familiar with the Western than with
the Eastern forms of Cybele-worship.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_653" href="#FNanchor_653" class="label">[182]</a> No mention of this sect is made by Irenæus or Epiphanius, and
Theodoret’s statements concerning it correspond so closely with those
of our text as to make it certain either that they were drawn from it or
that both he and Hippolytus drew from a common source. Yet
Clement of Alexandria knew of the Peratics (see <i>Stromateis</i> VII, 16), and
Origen (<i>cont. Cels.</i> VI, 28) speaks of the Ophites generally as boasting
Euphrates as their founder. The name given to them in our text is
said by Clement (<i>ubi cit.</i>) to be a place-name, and the better opinion
seems to be that it means “Mede” or one who lives on the further side
of the Euphrates. The main point of their doctrine seems to be the
great prominence given in it to the Serpent, whom they call the Son,
and make an intermediate power between the Father of All and Matter.
In this they are perhaps following the lead of some of the Græco-Oriental
worships like that of Sabazius, one of the many forms of Attis,
or that of Dionysos whose symbol was the serpent. The proof of their
doctrines, however, they sought for not, like the Naassenes, in the mystic
rites, but in a kind of astral theology which looked for religious truths
in the grouping of the stars; and it was in pursuit of this that they
identified the Saviour Serpent with the constellation Draco. Yet they
were ostensibly Christians, being apparently perfectly willing to accept
the historical Christ as their great intermediary. Their attitude to
Judaism is more difficult to grasp because, while they quoted freely
from the Old Testament, they apparently considered its God as an
evil, or at all events, an unnecessarily harsh, power, in which they
anticipated Manes and probably Marcion. Had we more of their
writings we should probably find in them the embodiment of a good
deal of early Babylonian tradition, to which most of these astrological
heresies paid great attention.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_719" href="#FNanchor_719" class="label">[248]</a> This chapter on the Peratæ is evidently drawn from more sources
than one. The author’s first statement of their doctrines, which occupies
pp. <a href="#Page_146">146</a>-<a href="#Page_149">149</a> <i>supra</i>, represents probably his first impression of them
and contains at least one glaring contradiction, duly noted in its
place. Then comes a long extract from Sextus Empiricus which is to all
appearance a repetition of the earliest part of Book IV, only pardonable
if it be allowed that the present Book was delivered in lecture form.
There follows a quotation longer and more sustained than any other in
the whole work from a Peratic book which he says was called <i>Proastii</i>,
with a bombastic prelude much resembling the language of Simon
Magus’ <i>Great Announcement</i> in Book VI, followed by a catalogue
of starry “influences” which reads much as if it were taken from some
astrological manual. There follows in its turn a dissertation on the
Ophite Serpent showing how this object of their adoration, identified
with the Brazen Serpent of Exodus, was made to prefigure or typify in
the most incongruous manner many personages in the Old and New
Testaments, including Christ Himself. After this he announces an
“epitome” of the Peratic doctrine which turns out to be perfectly
different from anything before said, divides the universe, which he
has previously said the Peratics divided into unbegotten, self-begotten
and begotten, into a new triad of Father, Son (<i>i. e.</i> Serpent), and Matter,
and gives a fairly consistent statement of the Peratic scheme of salvation
based on this hypothesis. One can only suppose here that this last
is an afterthought added when revising the book and inspired by some
fresh evidence of Peratic beliefs probably coloured by Stoic or
Marcionite doctrine. In those parts of the chapter which appear to
have been taken from genuinely Peratic sources, the reference to
some Western Asiatic tradition concerning cosmogony and the protoplasts
and differing considerably from the narrative of Genesis, is
plainly apparent.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_720" href="#FNanchor_720" class="label">[249]</a> This chapter is the most difficult of the whole book to account for,
with the doubtful exception of the much later one on the Docetæ. A
sect of Sethians is mentioned by Irenæus, who does not attempt to
separate their doctrines from those of the Ophites. Pseudo-Tertullian
in his tractate <i>Against All Heresies</i> also connects with the Ophites a
sect called Sethites or Sethoites, the main dogma he attributes to them
being an attempt to identify Christ with the Seth of Genesis. Epiphanius
follows this last author in this identification and calls them
Sethians, but does not expressly connect them with the Ophites, makes
them an Egyptian sect, and does not attribute to them serpent-worship.
The sectaries of this chapter are called in the rubric Sithiani, altered
to Sēthiani in the Summary of Book X, and the name is not necessarily
connected with that of the Patriarch. In the Bruce Papyrus, a Power,
good but subordinate to the Supreme God, is mentioned, called “the
Sitheus,” which may possibly, by analogy with the late-Egyptian Si-Osiris
and Si-Ammon, be construed “Son of God.” Of their doctrines
little can be made from Hippolytus’ brief but confused description.
Their division of the cosmos into three parts does not seem to differ
much from that of the Peratæ, although they make a sharper distinction
than this last between the world of light and that of darkness, which
has led Salmon (<i>D.C.B.</i> s.v., Ophites) to conjecture for them a Zoroastrian
origin. This is unlikely, and more attention is due to Hippolytus’
own statement that they derived their doctrines from Musæus,
Linus, and Orpheus. In <i>Forerunners</i> it is sought to show that the
Orphic teaching was one of the foundations on which the fabric of
Gnosticism was reared, and the image of the earth as a matrix was
certainly familiar to the Greeks, who made Delphi its ὀμφαλός or
navel. Hence the imagery of the text, offensive as it is to our ideas,
would not have been so to them, and Epiphanius (<i>Hær.</i>, XXXVIII, p.
510, Oehl.) knew of several writings, κατὰ τῆς Ὑστέρας, or the Womb,
which he says the sister sect of Cainites called the maker of heaven and
earth. In this case, we need not take the story in the text about the
generation by the bad or good serpent as necessarily referring to the Incarnation.
One of the scenes in the Mysteries of Attis-Sabazius, and
perhaps of those of Eleusis also, seems to have shown the seduction by
Zeus in serpent-form of his virgin daughter Persephone and the birth
therefrom of the Saviour Dionysos who was but his father re-born. This
story of the fecundation of the earth-goddess by a higher power in serpent
shape seems to have been present in all the religions of Western Asia, and
was therefore extremely likely to be caught hold of by an early form of
Gnosticism. In no other respect does this so-called “Sethian”
heresy seem to have anything in common with Christianity, and it may
therefore represent a pre-Christian form of Ophitism. The serpent in
it is, perhaps, neither bad nor good.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_750" href="#FNanchor_750" class="label">[279]</a> On the whole it may be said that this is the most suspect of all the
chapters in the <i>Philosophumena</i>, and that, if ever Hippolytus was
deceived into purchasing forged documents according to Salmon and
Stähelin’s theory, one of them appears here. Much of it is mere
verbiage as when, after having identified Mind or Nous with the
fragrance of the spirit, he again explains that it is a ray of light sent
from the perfect light, or when he explains the difference between the
three different kinds of law. The quotations too are seldom new, nearly
all of them appearing in other chapters and are, if it were possible, more
than usually inapposite, while almost the only new one is inaccurate.
The sentence about the Paraphrase (of) Seth, if that is the actual title of
the book, does not suggest that Hippolytus is quoting from that work,
nor does the phrase, “he says,” occur with anything like the frequency
of its use in <i>e. g.</i>, the Naassene chapter. On the whole, then, it seems
probable that in this Hippolytus was not copying or extracting from
any written document, but was writing down, to the best of his recollection
the statements of some convert who professed to be able to reveal
its teaching. It is significant in this respect that when the summary in
Book X had to be made, the summarizer makes no attempt to abbreviate
the statement of the supposed tenets of the Sethians, but merely copies
out the part of the chapter in which they are described, entirely omitting
the stories of the frescoed porch at Phlium and the oil-well at Ampa.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_751" href="#FNanchor_751" class="label">[280]</a> Nothing is known of this Justinus, whose name is not mentioned
by any other patristic writer, and there is no sure means of fixing his
date. Macmahon, relying apparently on the last sentence of the
chapter, would make him a predecessor of Simon Magus, and therefore
contemporary with the Apostles’ first preaching. This is extremely
unlikely, and Salmon on the other hand (<i>D.C.B.</i>, s.v., “Justinus
the Gnostic”) considers his heresy should be referred to “the latest
stage of Gnosticism” which, if taken literally, would make it long
posterior to Hippolytus. The source of his doctrine is equally obscure;
for although Hippolytus classes him with the Ophites, the serpent in his
system is certainly not good and plays as hostile a part towards man as
the serpent of Genesis, while his supreme Triad of the Good Being, an
intermediate power ignorant of the existence of his superior, and the
Earth, differs in all essential respects from the Ophite Trinity of the
First and Second Man and First Woman. Yet the names of the world-creating
angels and devils here given, bear a singular likeness to those
which Theodore bar Khôni in his <i>Book of Scholia</i> attributes to the
Ophites and also to those mentioned by Origen as appearing on the
Ophite Diagram. On the other hand, there are many likenesses not
only of ideas but of language between the system of Justinus and that
of Marcion, who also taught the existence of a Supreme and Benevolent
God and of a lower one, harsh, but just, who was the unwitting author
of the evil which is in the world. This, indeed, leaves out of the
account the third or female power; but an Armenian account of
Marcion’s doctrines attributes to him belief in a female power also,
called Hyle or Matter and the spouse of the Just God of the Law, with
whom her relations are pretty much as described in the text. Justinus,
however, was not like Marcion a believing Christian; for he makes his
Saviour the son of Joseph and Mary and the mere mouthpiece of the
subaltern angel Baruch, while his account of the Crucifixion differs
materially from that of Marcion. The obscene stories he tells about the
protoplasts also appear in much later Manichæan documents and seem
to be drawn from the Babylonian tradition of which the loves of the angels
in the Book of Enoch are probably also a survival. It is therefore not
improbable that Justinus, the Book of Enoch, the Ophites, and perhaps
Marcion, alike derived their tenets on these points from heathen myths
of the marriage of Heaven and Earth, which may possibly be traced
back to early Babylonian theories of cosmogony. Cf. <i>Forerunners</i>,
II, cc. 8 and 11, <i>passim</i>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_802" href="#FNanchor_802" class="label">[331]</a> Hosea i. 2. The A.V. has “<i>departing</i> from the Lord.” Here
we have Edem clearly identified with the Earth goddess which is the
key to the whole of Justinus’ story.</p>

Cruice, translates as above. It may well be, however, that the
“heresies which follow” only mean which follow in the book.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_804" href="#FNanchor_804" class="label">[333]</a> There is no reason to doubt Hippolytus’ assertion that this chapter
is compiled from a book called <i>Baruch</i> in which Justinus set forth his
own doctrines. The narrative therein is, unlike that of the earlier
chapters, perfectly coherent and plain, and the author’s use of the
historical present gives it a dramatic form which is lacking from the
<i>oratio obliqua</i> formerly employed. Solecisms like the omission of
the article are also rare, and the very long sentences in which Hippolytus
seems to have delighted do not appear except in those passages
where he is speaking in his own person. Whether from this or from
some other cause, moreover, the transcription of it seems to have given
less difficulty to the scribe Michael than some of the other chapters, and
there is therefore far less need to constantly restore the text as in the
case of the quotations from Sextus Empiricus. On the whole, therefore,
we may assume that, as we have it, it is a genuine summary of Justinus’
doctrines taken from a work by his own hand.</p>

<p class="center noin p1">EXTRACTS FROM PRESS NOTICES.</p>

<p><b>The Times Literary Supplement</b> says: “These Jewish Apocalypses
have a direct relation to the thought and religious ideals which confronted
primitive Christianity in Palestine, and not only for their own
sakes, but for their influence on the New Testament and Apostolic
Christianity they deserve careful attention. Handbooks at once so
scholarly and so readable will be welcomed by all interested in
Christian origins.”</p>

<p><b>The Church Quarterly Review</b> says: “To the theological student
who is anxious to know something of the circumstances and thought
of the time during which Christianity grew up, and of the Jewish
environment of the teaching of our Lord and the Apostles, there is
no class of books more valuable than the later Jewish Apocrypha.”</p>

<p><b>The Church Times</b> says: “The names of the Editors are a
guarantee of trustworthy and expert scholarship, and their work
has been admirably performed.”</p>

<p><b>The Tablet</b> says: “A valuable series ... well brought out and
should prove useful to students.”</p>

<p><b>Catholic Book Notes</b> says: “The S.P.C.K. is to be congratulated
on its various series of cheap and useful books for students.”</p>

<p><b>The Journal of the Society of Oriental Research (U.S.A.)</b> says:
“The S.P.C.K. have again made the whole body of students,
interested in things Jewish and Early Christian, their debtors ...
their splendid work in this series.”</p>

<p><b>The Living Church (U.S.A.)</b> says: “To praise this project too
highly is an impossibility. Everyone has felt the need of such a
series of handy and inexpensive translations of these documents and
... we are assured of excellent results.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
